Equip,IDLEREADY,67,IDLE,The tester is ready to begin processing and is awaiting a START command.
Equip,PROCESSING,68,PROCESSINGACTIVE,(PROCESSINGACTIVE substate) This state is the parent of those substates that exist in the Port State Model and refer to the preparation and execution of a process program.
Equip,STOPPING,69,PROCESSINGACTIVE,"(PROCESSINGACTIVE substate) The tester has completed a process program or has been instructed to stop processing and shall do so at the next opportunity.  All necessary cleanup is completed within this state with regard to material, data, control system, etc.  Data is preserved.  Any error condition is cleared before exiting from this state."
Equip,ALARMPAUSED,70,PAUSE,"(PAUSE substate) An alarm has occurred in the PROCESSING, CHECKING, PAUSING, or PAUSED states, and the tester is waiting for the alarm to be cleared."
Equip,PAUSE,,PROCESSINGACTIVE,"(Parent state) The tester has received an alarm or PAUSE command.  As a parent state, the equipment never  transitions to PAUSE, but into one of its substates."
Equip,PROCESSPAUSE,,PAUSE,"(PAUSE substate and parent state) The tester is free of alarm conditions in the PAUSE state.  As a parent state, the equipment never transitions to PROCESSPAUSE, but into one of its substates."
Equip,PAUSING,71,PROCESSPAUSE,"(PROCESSPAUSE substate) The current state will be suspended at the completion of the current unit(s), if any, and the tester will be brought to a safe place."

Equip,CHECKING,73,PROCESSPAUSE,"(PROCESSPAUSE substate) The tester verifies that updates made to the process program are valid.  This is a similar procedure to that which is done in SETTING UP.  At  the successful completion of verification, a transition is made to the process state, based on the process model condition table."
Equip,IDLE,,,"(Parent state) Awaiting a command.  IDLE is free of ALARMS and error conditions.  A program may or may not be loaded in the execution space during this state.  Because IDLE is a parent states, the equipment will only by able to stop in one of the IDLE substates.  There is never a transition to IDLE."

Equip,ABORTING,77,PROCESSINGACTIVE,"(PROCESSINGACTIVE substate) The tester has received an ABORT command.  All activity is suspended.  The tester is taking appropriate action to bring itself and material to a ""safe"" state where possible.  Unit or lot data may be invalid or not available"

Port,SUBLOTCOMPLETE,108,WORKING,The tester has completed a wafer test.
Port,PENDINGCOMPLETE,109,ENDOFTEST,Used as a waiting state for direction to either retest wafers or complete the lot.
Port,LOTCOMPLETE,110,ENDOFTEST,The tester has completed the testing of a lot. LOTCOMPLETE is a pass thru state.
Port,STARTING,114,EXECUTING,The tester has been notified of a job start but the job has not started yet.
Port,RELEASING,115,ENDOFTEST,"Processing has completed on the lot on the port and the prober is completing its release process.
"
Port,RELEASED,116,ENDOFTEST,"The prober has completed its release of the lot on the port and the carrier may be removed.
"
Port,RESETUP,117,ENDOFTEST,"The system is setting up the recipe for an adaptive test of the lot on the port.
"
Port,PENDINGCLOSE,118,ENDOFTEST,"The adaptive test failed its setup or was cancelled.  The lot may be tested with a different recipe or completed and removed from the equipment.
"
Port,WORKING,,EXECUTING,The parent state in which all testing is conducted
Port,ENDOFTEST,,EXECUTING,"The parent state in which testing has finished, awaiting instructions for next action."
