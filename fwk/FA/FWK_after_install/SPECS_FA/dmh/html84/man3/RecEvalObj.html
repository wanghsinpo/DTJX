<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj</B> is invoked to record a command as an event
on the history list and then execute it using <B>Tcl_EvalObjEx</B>
(or <B>Tcl_GlobalEvalObj</B> if the TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL bit is set
in <I>flags</I>).
It returns a completion code such as TCL_OK just like <B>Tcl_EvalObjEx</B>,
as well as a result object containing additional information
(a result value or error message)
that can be retrieved using <B>Tcl_GetObjResult</B>.
If you don't want the command recorded on the history list then
you should invoke <B>Tcl_EvalObjEx</B> instead of <B>Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj</B>.
Normally <B>Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj</B> is only called with top-level
commands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to
allow the user to re-issue recently-invoked commands.
If the <I>flags</I> argument contains the TCL_NO_EVAL bit then
the command is recorded without being evaluated.
