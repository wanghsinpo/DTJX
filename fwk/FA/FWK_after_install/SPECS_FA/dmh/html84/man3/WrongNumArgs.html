in its result object.

message.

<DD>Additional error information to print after leading arguments
from <I>objv</I>.  This typically gives the acceptable syntax
of the command.  This argument may be NULL.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Tcl_WrongNumArgs</B> is a utility procedure that is invoked by
command procedures when they discover that they have received the
wrong number of arguments.  <B>Tcl_WrongNumArgs</B> generates a
standard error message and stores it in the result object of
<I>interp</I>.  The message includes the <I>objc</I> initial
elements of <I>objv</I> plus <I>message</I>.  For example, if
<I>objv</I> consists of the values <B>foo</B> and <B>bar</B>,
<I>objc</I> is 1, and <I>message</I> is ``<B>fileName count</B>''
then <I>interp</I>'s result object will be set to the following
string:
<PRE>
wrong # args: should be "foo fileName count"
</PRE>
If <I>objc</I> is 2, the result will be set to the following string: <PRE>
wrong # args: should be "foo bar fileName count"
</PRE>
<I>Objc</I> is usually 1, but may be 2 or more for commands like <B>string</B> and the Tk widget commands, which use the first argument as a subcommand.   <P>
Some of the objects in the <I>objv</I> array may be abbreviations for a subcommand.  The command <B>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</B> will convert the abbreviated string object into an <I>indexObject</I>.  If an error occurs in the parsing of the subcommand we would like to use the full subcommand name rather than the abbreviation.  If the <B>Tcl_WrongNumArgs</B> command finds any <I>indexObjects</I> in the <I>objv</I> array it will use the full subcommand name in the error message instead of the abbreviated name that was originally passed in.  Using the above example, lets assume that <I>bar</I> is actually an abbreviation for <I>barfly</I> and the object is now an indexObject because it was passed to <B>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</B>.  In this case the error message would be: <PRE>
wrong # args: should be "foo barfly fileName count"
</PRE>
