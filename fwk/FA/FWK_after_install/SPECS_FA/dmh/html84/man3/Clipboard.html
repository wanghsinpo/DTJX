<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
These two procedures manage the clipboard for Tk.
The clipboard is typically managed by calling <B>Tk_ClipboardClear</B>
once, then calling <B>Tk_ClipboardAppend</B> to add data for any
number of targets.
<P>
<B>Tk_ClipboardClear</B> claims the CLIPBOARD selection and frees any
data items previously stored on the clipboard in this application.  
It normally returns TCL_OK, but if an error occurs it returns
TCL_ERROR and leaves an error message in <I>interp-&gt;result</I>.
<B>Tk_ClipboardClear</B> must be called before a sequence of
<B>Tk_ClipboardAppend</B> calls can be issued.
<P>
<B>Tk_ClipboardAppend</B> appends a buffer of data to the clipboard.
The first buffer for a given <I>target</I> determines the <I>format</I>
for that <I>target</I>.
Any successive appends for that <I>target</I> must have
the same format or an error will be returned.
<B>Tk_ClipboardAppend</B> returns TCL_OK if the buffer is
successfully copied onto the clipboard.  If the clipboard is not
currently owned by the application, either
because <B>Tk_ClipboardClear</B> has not been called or because
ownership of the clipboard has changed since the last call to
<B>Tk_ClipboardClear</B>,
<B>Tk_ClipboardAppend</B> returns TCL_ERROR and leaves an error message in
<I>interp-&gt;result</I>.
<P>
In order to guarantee atomicity, no event handling should occur
between <B>Tk_ClipboardClear</B> and the following
<B>Tk_ClipboardAppend</B> calls (otherwise someone could retrieve
a partially completed clipboard or claim ownership away from
this application).
<P>
<B>Tk_ClipboardClear</B> may invoke callbacks, including arbitrary
Tcl scripts, as a result of losing the CLIPBOARD selection, so
any calling function should take care to be reentrant at the point
<B>Tk_ClipboardClear</B> is invoked.
