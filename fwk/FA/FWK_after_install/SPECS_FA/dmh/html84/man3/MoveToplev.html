<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
In general, a window should never set its own position;  this should be
done only by the geometry manger that is responsible for the window.
For top-level windows the window manager is effectively the geometry
manager;  Tk provides interface code between the application and the
window manager to convey the application's desires to the geometry
manager.  The desired size for a top-level window is conveyed using
the usual <B>Tk_GeometryRequest</B> mechanism.  The procedure
<B>Tk_MoveToplevelWindow</B> may be used by an application to request
a particular position for a top-level window;  this procedure is
similar in function to the <B>wm geometry</B> Tcl command except that
negative offsets cannot be specified.  It is invoked by widgets such as
menus that want to appear at a particular place on the screen.
<P>
When <B>Tk_MoveToplevelWindow</B> is called it doesn't immediately
pass on the new desired location to the window manager;  it defers
this action until all other outstanding work has been completed,
using the <B>Tk_DoWhenIdle</B> mechanism.
