<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
These procedure parses the string and fills in the result in the
Tk_Dash structure. The string can be a list of integers or a
character string containing only <B>[.,-_]</B> or spaces. If all
goes well, TCL_OK is returned. If <I>string</I> doesn't have the
proper syntax then TCL_ERROR is returned, an error message is left
in the interpreter's result, and nothing is stored at *<I>dashPtr</I>.
<P>
The first possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element
represents the number of pixels of a line segment. Only the odd
segments are drawn using the "outline" color. The other segments
are drawn transparent.
<P>
The second possible syntax is a character list containing only
5 possible characters <B>[.,-_ ]</B>. The space can be used
to enlarge the space between other line elements, and can not
occur as the first posibion in the string. Some examples:
    -dash .     = -dash {2 4}
    -dash -     = -dash {6 4}
    -dash -.    = -dash {6 4 2 4}
    -dash -..   = -dash {6 4 2 4 2 4}
    -dash {. }  = -dash {2 8}
    -dash ,     = -dash {4 4}
<P>
The main difference of this syntax with the previous is that it
it shape-conserving. This means that all values in the dash
list will be multiplied by the line width before display. This
assures that "." will always be displayed as a dot and "-"
always as a dash regardless of the line width.
<P>
On systems where only a limited set of dash patterns, the dash
pattern will be displayed as the most close dash pattern that
is available. For example, on Windows only the first 4 of the
above examples are available. The last 2 examples will be
displayed identically as the first one.
