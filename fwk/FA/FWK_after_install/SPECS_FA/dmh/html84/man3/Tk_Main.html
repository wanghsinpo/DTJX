<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Tk_Main</B> acts as the main program for most Tk-based applications.
Starting with Tk 4.0 it is not called <B>main</B> anymore because it 
is part of the Tk library and having a function <B>main</B>
in a library (particularly a shared library) causes problems on many
systems.
Having <B>main</B> in the Tk library would also make it hard to use
Tk in C++ programs, since C++ programs must have special C++
<B>main</B> functions.
<P>
Normally each application contains a small <B>main</B> function that does
nothing but invoke <B>Tk_Main</B>.
<B>Tk_Main</B> then does all the work of creating and running a
<B>wish</B>-like application.
<P>
When it is has finished its own initialization, but before
it processes commands, <B>Tk_Main</B> calls the procedure given by
the <I>appInitProc</I> argument.  This procedure provides a ``hook''
for the application to perform its own initialization, such as defining
application-specific commands.  The procedure must have an interface
that matches the type <B>Tcl_AppInitProc</B>:
<PRE>
typedef int Tcl_AppInitProc(Tcl_Interp *<I>interp</I>);
</PRE>
<I>AppInitProc</I> is almost always a pointer to <B>Tcl_AppInit</B>; for more details on this procedure, see the documentation for <B>Tcl_AppInit</B>. <P>
