<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A hash table consists of zero or more entries, each consisting of a
key and a value.  Given the key for an entry, the hashing routines can
very quickly locate the entry, and hence its value. There may be at
most one entry in a hash table with a particular key, but many entries
may have the same value.  Keys can take one of four forms: strings,
one-word values, integer arrays, or custom keys defined by a
Tcl_HashKeyType structure (See section <B>THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE
STRUCTURE</B> below). All of the keys in a given table have the same
form, which is specified when the table is initialized.
<P>
The value of a hash table entry can be anything that fits in the same
space as a ``char *'' pointer.  Values for hash table entries are
managed entirely by clients, not by the hash module itself.  Typically
each entry's value is a pointer to a data structure managed by client
code.
<P>
Hash tables grow gracefully as the number of entries increases, so
that there are always less than three entries per hash bucket, on
average. This allows for fast lookups regardless of the number of
entries in a table.
<P>
The core provides three functions for the initialization of hash
tables, Tcl_InitHashTable, Tcl_InitObjHashTable and
Tcl_InitCustomHashTable.
<P>
<B>Tcl_InitHashTable</B> initializes a structure that describes a new
hash table.  The space for the structure is provided by the caller,
not by the hash module.  The value of <I>keyType</I> indicates what
kinds of keys will be used for all entries in the table. All of the
key types described later are allowed, with the exception of
<B>TCL_CUSTOM_TYPE_KEYS</B> and <B>TCL_CUSTOM_PTR_KEYS</B>.
<P>
<B>Tcl_InitObjHashTable</B> is a wrapper around
<B>Tcl_InitCustomHashTable</B> and initializes a hash table whose keys
are Tcl_Obj *.
<P>
<B>Tcl_InitCustomHashTable</B> initializes a structure that describes a
new hash table. The space for the structure is provided by the
caller, not by the hash module.  The value of <I>keyType</I> indicates
what kinds of keys will be used for all entries in the table.
<I>KeyType</I> must have one of the following values:

<DT><B>TCL_STRING_KEYS</B>
<DD>Keys are null-terminated strings. They are passed to hashing routines using the address of the first character of the string. 
<DT><B>TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS</B>
<DD>Keys are single-word values;  they are passed to hashing routines and stored in hash table entries as ``char *'' values. The pointer value is the key;  it need not (and usually doesn't) actually point to a string. 
<DT><B>TCL_CUSTOM_TYPE_KEYS</B>
<DD>Keys are of arbitrary type, and are stored in the entry. Hashing and comparison is determined by <I>typePtr</I>. The Tcl_HashKeyType  structure is described in the section  <B>THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE</B> below. 
<DT><B>TCL_CUSTOM_PTR_KEYS</B>
<DD>Keys are pointers to an arbitrary type, and are stored in the entry. Hashing and comparison is determined by <I>typePtr</I>. The Tcl_HashKeyType  structure is described in the section  <B>THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE</B> below. 
<DT><I>other</I>
<DD>If <I>keyType</I> is not one of the above, then it must be an integer value greater than 1. In this case the keys will be arrays of ``int'' values, where <I>keyType</I> gives the number of ints in each key. This allows structures to be used as keys. All keys must have the same size. Array keys are passed into hashing functions using the address of the first int in the array. <P>
<B>Tcl_DeleteHashTable</B> deletes all of the entries in a hash table and frees up the memory associated with the table's bucket array and entries. It does not free the actual table structure (pointed to by <I>tablePtr</I>), since that memory is assumed to be managed by the client. <B>Tcl_DeleteHashTable</B> also does not free or otherwise manipulate the values of the hash table entries. If the entry values point to dynamically-allocated memory, then it is the client's responsibility to free these structures before deleting the table. <P>
<B>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</B> locates the entry corresponding to a particular key, creating a new entry in the table if there wasn't already one with the given key. If an entry already existed with the given key then <I>*newPtr</I> is set to zero. If a new entry was created, then <I>*newPtr</I> is set to a non-zero value and the value of the new entry will be set to zero. The return value from <B>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</B> is a pointer to the entry, which may be used to retrieve and modify the entry's value or to delete the entry from the table. <P>
<B>Tcl_DeleteHashEntry</B> will remove an existing entry from a table. The memory associated with the entry itself will be freed, but the client is responsible for any cleanup associated with the entry's value, such as freeing a structure that it points to. <P>
<B>Tcl_FindHashEntry</B> is similar to <B>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</B> except that it doesn't create a new entry if the key doesn't exist; instead, it returns NULL as result. <P>
<B>Tcl_GetHashValue</B> and <B>Tcl_SetHashValue</B> are used to read and write an entry's value, respectively. Values are stored and retrieved as type ``ClientData'', which is large enough to hold a pointer value.  On almost all machines this is large enough to hold an integer value too. <P>
<B>Tcl_GetHashKey</B> returns the key for a given hash table entry, either as a pointer to a string, a one-word (``char *'') key, or as a pointer to the first word of an array of integers, depending on the <I>keyType</I> used to create a hash table. In all cases <B>Tcl_GetHashKey</B> returns a result with type ``char *''. When the key is a string or array, the result of <B>Tcl_GetHashKey</B> points to information in the table entry;  this information will remain valid until the entry is deleted or its table is deleted. <P>
<B>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</B> and <B>Tcl_NextHashEntry</B> may be used to scan all of the entries in a hash table. A structure of type ``Tcl_HashSearch'', provided by the client, is used to keep track of progress through the table. <B>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</B> initializes the search record and returns the first entry in the table (or NULL if the table is empty). Each subsequent call to <B>Tcl_NextHashEntry</B> returns the next entry in the table or NULL if the end of the table has been reached. A call to <B>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</B> followed by calls to <B>Tcl_NextHashEntry</B> will return each of the entries in the table exactly once, in an arbitrary order. It is unadvisable to modify the structure of the table, e.g. by creating or deleting entries, while the search is in progress. <P>
<B>Tcl_HashStats</B> returns a dynamically-allocated string with overall information about a hash table, such as the number of entries it contains, the number of buckets in its hash array, and the utilization of the buckets. It is the caller's responsibility to free the result string by passing it to <B>ckfree</B>. <P>
The header file <B>tcl.h</B> defines the actual data structures used to implement hash tables. This is necessary so that clients can allocate Tcl_HashTable structures and so that macros can be used to read and write the values of entries. However, users of the hashing routines should never refer directly to any of the fields of any of the hash-related data structures; use the procedures and macros defined here. <P>
<H2>THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE</H2>
 <P>
Extension writers can define new hash key types by defining four procedures, initializing a Tcl_HashKeyType structure to describe the type, and calling <B>Tcl_InitCustomHashTable</B>. The <B>Tcl_HashKeyType</B> structure is defined as follows: <PRE>
typedef struct Tcl_HashKeyType {
    int <I>version</I>;
    int <I>flags</I>;
    Tcl_HashKeyProc *<I>hashKeyProc</I>;
    Tcl_CompareHashKeysProc *<I>compareKeysProc</I>;
    Tcl_AllocHashEntryProc *<I>allocEntryProc</I>;
    Tcl_FreeHashEntryProc *<I>freeEntryProc</I>;
} Tcl_HashKeyType;
</PRE>
<P>
The <I>version</I> member is the version of the table. If this structure is extended in future then the version can be used to distinguish between different structures. It should be set to <B>TCL_HASH_KEY_TYPE_VERSION</B>. <P>
The <I>flags</I> member is one or more of the following values OR'ed together: 
<DT><B>TCL_HASH_KEY_RANDOMIZE_HASH</B>
<DD>There are some things, pointers for example which don't hash well  because they do not use the lower bits. If this flag is set then the hash table will attempt to rectify this by randomising the bits and  then using the upper N bits as the index into the table. <P>
The <I>hashKeyProc</I> member contains the address of a function  called to calculate a hash value for the key. <PRE>
typedef unsigned int (Tcl_HashKeyProc) (
    Tcl_HashTable *<I>tablePtr</I>,
    VOID *<I>keyPtr</I>);
</PRE>
If this is NULL then <I>keyPtr</I> is used and  <B>TCL_HASH_KEY_RANDOMIZE_HASH</B> is assumed. <P>
The <I>compareKeysProc</I> member contains the address of a function  called to compare two keys. <PRE>
typedef int (Tcl_CompareHashKeysProc) (VOID *<I>keyPtr</I>,
    Tcl_HashEntry *<I>hPtr</I>);
</PRE>
If this is NULL then the <I>keyPtr</I> pointers are compared. If the keys don't match then the function returns 0, otherwise it returns 1. <P>
The <I>allocEntryProc</I> member contains the address of a function  called to allocate space for an entry and initialise the key. <PRE>
typedef Tcl_HashEntry *(Tcl_AllocHashEntryProc) (
    Tcl_HashTable *<I>tablePtr</I>, VOID *<I>keyPtr</I>);
</PRE>
If this is NULL then Tcl_Alloc is used to allocate enough space for a Tcl_HashEntry and the key pointer is assigned to key.oneWordValue. String keys and array keys use this function to allocate enough  space for the entry and the key in one block, rather than doing it in two blocks. This saves space for a pointer to the key from the entry and another memory allocation. Tcl_Obj * keys use this  function to allocate enough space for an entry and increment the  reference count on the object. If  <P>
The <I>freeEntryProc</I> member contains the address of a function  called to free space for an entry. <PRE>
typedef void (Tcl_FreeHashEntryProc) (Tcl_HashEntry *<I>hPtr</I>);
</PRE>
If this is NULL then Tcl_Free is used to free the space for the  entry. Tcl_Obj * keys use this function to decrement the reference count on the object. <P>
