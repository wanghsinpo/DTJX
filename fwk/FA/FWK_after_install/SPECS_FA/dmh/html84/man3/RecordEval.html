<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Tcl_RecordAndEval</B> is invoked to record a command as an event
on the history list and then execute it using <B>Tcl_Eval</B>
(or <B>Tcl_GlobalEval</B> if the TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL bit is set in <I>flags</I>).
It returns a completion code such as TCL_OK just like <B>Tcl_Eval</B>
and it leaves information in the interpreter's result.
If you don't want the command recorded on the history list then
you should invoke <B>Tcl_Eval</B> instead of <B>Tcl_RecordAndEval</B>.
Normally <B>Tcl_RecordAndEval</B> is only called with top-level
commands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to
allow the user to re-issue recently-invoked commands.
If the <I>flags</I> argument contains the TCL_NO_EVAL bit then
the command is recorded without being evaluated.
<P>
Note that <B>Tcl_RecordAndEval</B> has been largely replaced by the
object-based procedure <B>Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj</B>.
That object-based procedure records and optionally executes
a command held in a Tcl object instead of a string.
