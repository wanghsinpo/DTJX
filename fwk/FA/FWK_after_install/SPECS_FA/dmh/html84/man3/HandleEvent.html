<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Tk_HandleEvent</B> is a lower-level procedure that deals with window
events.  It is called by <B>Tcl_ServiceEvent</B> (and indirectly by
<B>Tk_DoOneEvent</B>), and in a few other cases within Tk.
It makes callbacks to any window event
handlers (created by calls to <B>Tk_CreateEventHandler</B>)
that match <I>eventPtr</I> and then returns.  In some cases
it may be useful for an application to bypass the Tk event
queue and call <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B> directly instead of
calling <B>Tcl_QueueEvent</B> followed by
<B>Tcl_ServiceEvent</B>.
<P>
This procedure may be invoked recursively.  For example,
it is possible to invoke <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B> recursively
from a handler called by <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B>.  This sort
of operation is useful in some modal situations, such
as when a
notifier has been popped up and an application wishes to
wait for the user to click a button in the notifier before
doing anything else.
