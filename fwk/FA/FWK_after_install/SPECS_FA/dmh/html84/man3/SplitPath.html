There will be <I>*argcPtr</I> valid entries in the array, followed by
a NULL entry.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
These procedures have been superceded by the objectified procedures in
the <B>FileSystem</B> man page, which are more efficient.
<P>
These procedures may be used to disassemble and reassemble file
paths in a platform independent manner: they provide C-level access to
the same functionality as the <B>file split</B>, <B>file join</B>, and
<B>file pathtype</B> commands.
<P>
<B>Tcl_SplitPath</B> breaks a path into its constituent elements,
returning an array of pointers to the elements using <I>argcPtr</I> and
<I>argvPtr</I>.  The area of memory pointed to by <I>*argvPtr</I> is
dynamically allocated; in addition to the array of pointers, it also
holds copies of all the path elements.  It is the caller's
responsibility to free all of this storage.
For example, suppose that you have called <B>Tcl_SplitPath</B> with the
following code:
<PRE>
int argc;
char *path;
char **argv;
...
Tcl_SplitPath(string, &amp;argc, &amp;argv);
</PRE>
Then you should eventually free the storage with a call like the following: <PRE>
Tcl_Free((char *) argv);
</PRE>
<P>
<B>Tcl_JoinPath</B> is the inverse of <B>Tcl_SplitPath</B>: it takes a collection of path elements given by <I>argc</I> and <I>argv</I> and generates a result string that is a properly constructed path. The result string is appended to <I>resultPtr</I>.  <I>ResultPtr</I> must refer to an initialized <B>Tcl_DString</B>. <P>
If the result of <B>Tcl_SplitPath</B> is passed to <B>Tcl_JoinPath</B>, the result will refer to the same location, but may not be in the same form.  This is because <B>Tcl_SplitPath</B> and <B>Tcl_JoinPath</B> eliminate duplicate path separators and return a normalized form for each platform. <P>
<B>Tcl_GetPathType</B> returns the type of the specified <I>path</I>, where <B>Tcl_PathType</B> is one of <B>TCL_PATH_ABSOLUTE</B>, <B>TCL_PATH_RELATIVE</B>, or <B>TCL_PATH_VOLUME_RELATIVE</B>.  See the <B>filename</B> manual entry for a description of the path types for each platform. <P>
