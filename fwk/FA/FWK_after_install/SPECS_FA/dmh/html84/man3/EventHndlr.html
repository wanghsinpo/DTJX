<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Tk_CreateEventHandler</B> arranges for <I>proc</I> to be
invoked in the future whenever one of the event types specified
by <I>mask</I> occurs in the window specified by <I>tkwin</I>.
The callback to <I>proc</I> will be made by <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B>;
this mechanism only works in programs that dispatch events
through <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B> (or through other Tk procedures that
call <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B>, such as <B>Tk_DoOneEvent</B> or
<B>Tk_MainLoop</B>).
<P>
<I>Proc</I> should have arguments and result that match the
type <B>Tk_EventProc</B>:
<PRE>
typedef void Tk_EventProc(
	ClientData <I>clientData</I>,
	XEvent *<I>eventPtr</I>);
</PRE>
The <I>clientData</I> parameter to <I>proc</I> is a copy of the <I>clientData</I> argument given to <B>Tk_CreateEventHandler</B> when the callback was created.  Typically, <I>clientData</I> points to a data structure containing application-specific information about the window in which the event occurred.  <I>EventPtr</I> is a pointer to the X event, which will be one of the ones specified in the <I>mask</I> argument to <B>Tk_CreateEventHandler</B>. <P>
<B>Tk_DeleteEventHandler</B> may be called to delete a previously-created event handler:  it deletes the first handler it finds that is associated with <I>tkwin</I> and matches the <I>mask</I>, <I>proc</I>, and <I>clientData</I> arguments.  If no such handler exists, then <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B> returns without doing anything.  Although Tk supports it, it's probably a bad idea to have more than one callback with the same <I>mask</I>, <I>proc</I>, and <I>clientData</I> arguments. When a window is deleted all of its handlers will be deleted automatically;  in this case there is no need to call <B>Tk_DeleteEventHandler</B>. <P>
If multiple handlers are declared for the same type of X event on the same window, then the handlers will be invoked in the order they were created. <P>
