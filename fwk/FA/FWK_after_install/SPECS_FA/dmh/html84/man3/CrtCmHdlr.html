<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2>

<P><DT><B>Tk_ClientMessageProc <I>*proc</I></B> (in)
<DD>Procedure to invoke whenever a ClientMessage X event occurs on any display.
<HR>

<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<P>
<B>Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler</B> arranges for <I>proc</I> to be invoked
in the future whenever a ClientMessage X event occurs that isn't handled by
<B>WM_PROTOCOL</B>.  <B>Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler</B> is intended for use
by applications which need to watch X ClientMessage events, such as drag and
drop applications.
<P>
The callback to <I>proc</I> will be made by <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B>;
this mechanism only works in programs that dispatch events
through <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B> (or through other Tk procedures that
call <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B>, such as <B>Tk_DoOneEvent</B> or
<B>Tk_MainLoop</B>).
<P>
<I>Proc</I> should have arguments and result that match the
type <B>Tk_ClientMessageProc</B>:
<PRE>
typedef int Tk_ClientMessageProc(
	Tk_Window <I>tkwin</I>,
	XEvent *<I>eventPtr</I>);
</PRE>
The <I>tkwin</I> parameter to <I>proc</I> is the Tk window which is associated with this event.  <I>EventPtr</I> is a pointer to the X event. <P>
Whenever an X ClientMessage event is processed by <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B>, the <I>proc</I> is called if it wasn't handled as a <B>WM_PROTOCOL</B>. The return value from <I>proc</I> is normally 0. A non-zero return value indicates that the event is not to be handled further; that is, <I>proc</I> has done all processing that is to be allowed for the event. <P>
If there are multiple ClientMessage event handlers, each one is called for each event, in the order in which they were established. <P>
<B>Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler</B> may be called to delete a previously-created ClientMessage event handler: it deletes each handler it finds that matches the <I>proc</I> argument.  If no such handler exists, then <B>Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler</B> returns without doing anything. Although Tk supports it, it's probably a bad idea to have more than one callback with the same <I>proc</I> argument. <P>
