<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</B> arranges for command tracing.  After it is
called, <I>objProc</I> will be invoked before the Tcl interpreter calls
any command procedure when evaluating commands in <I>interp</I>.
The return value from <B>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</B> is a token for the trace,
which may be passed to <B>Tcl_DeleteTrace</B> to remove the trace.
There may be many traces in effect simultaneously for the same
interpreter.
<P>
<I>objProc</I> should have arguments and result that match the type,
<B>Tcl_CmdObjTraceProc</B>:
<PRE>
typedef int <B>Tcl_CmdObjTraceProc</B>( 
    <B>ClientData</B> <I>clientData</I>,
    <B>Tcl_Interp</B>* <I>interp</I>,
    int <I>level</I>,
    CONST char* <I>command</I>,
    <B>Tcl_Command</B> <I>commandToken</I>,
    int <I>objc</I>,
    <B>Tcl_Obj</B> *CONST <I>objv</I>[] );
</PRE>
The <I>clientData</I> and <I>interp</I> parameters are copies of the corresponding arguments given to <B>Tcl_CreateTrace</B>. <I>ClientData</I> typically points to an application-specific data structure that describes what to do when <I>objProc</I> is invoked.  The <I>level</I> parameter gives the nesting level of the command (1 for top-level commands passed to <B>Tcl_Eval</B> by the application, 2 for the next-level commands passed to <B>Tcl_Eval</B> as part of parsing or interpreting level-1 commands, and so on). The <I>command</I> parameter points to a string containing the text of the command, before any argument substitution.  The <I>commandToken</I> parameter is a Tcl command token that identifies the command to be invoked.  The token may be passed to <B>Tcl_GetCommandName</B>, <B>Tcl_GetCommandTokenInfo</B>, or <B>Tcl_SetCommandTokenInfo</B> to manipulate the definition of the command. The <I>objc</I> and <I>objv</I> parameters designate the final parameter count and parameter vector that will be passed to the command, and have had all substitutions performed. <P>
The <I>objProc</I> callback is expected to return a standard Tcl status return code.  If this code is <B>TCL_OK</B> (the normal case), then the Tcl interpreter will invoke the command.  Any other return code is treated as if the command returned that status, and the command is <I>not</I> invoked. <P>
The <I>objProc</I> callback must not modify <I>objv</I> in any way.  It is, however, permissible to change the command by calling <B>Tcl_SetCommandTokenInfo</B> prior to returning.  Any such change takes effect immediately, and the command is invoked with the new information. <P>
Tracing will only occur for commands at nesting level less than or equal to the <I>level</I> parameter (i.e. the <I>level</I> parameter to <I>objProc</I> will always be less than or equal to the <I>level</I> parameter to <B>Tcl_CreateTrace</B>). <P>
Tracing has a significant effect on runtime performance because it causes the bytecode compiler to refrain from generating in-line code for Tcl commands such as <B>if</B> and <B>while</B> in order that they may be traced.  If traces for the built-in commands are not required, the <I>flags</I> parameter may be set to the constant value <B>TCL_ALLOW_INLINE_COMPILATION</B>.  In this case, traces on built-in commands may or may not result in trace callbacks, depending on the state of the interpreter, but run-time performance will be improved significantly.  (This functionality is desirable, for example, when using <B>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</B> to implement an execution time profiler.) <P>
Calls to <I>objProc</I> will be made by the Tcl parser immediately before it calls the command procedure for the command (<I>cmdProc</I>).  This occurs after argument parsing and substitution, so tracing for substituted commands occurs before tracing of the commands containing the substitutions.  If there is a syntax error in a command, or if there is no command procedure associated with a command name, then no tracing will occur for that command.  If a string passed to Tcl_Eval contains multiple commands (bracketed, or on different lines) then multiple calls to <I>objProc</I> will occur, one for each command. <P>
<B>Tcl_DeleteTrace</B> removes a trace, so that no future calls will be made to the procedure associated with the trace.  After <B>Tcl_DeleteTrace</B> returns, the caller should never again use the <I>trace</I> token. <P>
When <B>Tcl_DeleteTrace</B> is called, the interpreter invokes the <I>deleteProc</I> that was passed as a parameter to <B>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</B>.  The <I>deleteProc</I> must match the type, <B>Tcl_CmdObjTraceDeleteProc</B>: <PRE>
typedef void <B>Tcl_CmdObjTraceDeleteProc</B>( 
    <B>ClientData</B> <I>clientData</I>
);
</PRE>
The <I>clientData</I> parameter will be the same as the <I>clientData</I> parameter that was originally passed to <B>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</B>. <P>
<B>Tcl_CreateTrace</B> is an alternative interface for command tracing, <I>not recommended for new applications</I>.  It is provided for backward compatibility with code that was developed for older versions of the Tcl interpreter.  It is similar to <B>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</B>, except that its <I>proc</I> parameter should have arguments and result that match the type <B>Tcl_CmdTraceProc</B>: <PRE>
typedef void Tcl_CmdTraceProc(
	ClientData <I>clientData</I>,
	Tcl_Interp *<I>interp</I>,
	int <I>level</I>,
	char *<I>command</I>,
	Tcl_CmdProc *<I>cmdProc</I>,
	ClientData <I>cmdClientData</I>,
	int <I>argc</I>,
	CONST char *<I>argv</I>[]);
</PRE>
The parameters to the <I>proc</I> callback are similar to those of the <I>objProc</I> callback above. The <I>commandToken</I> is replaced with <I>cmdProc</I>, a pointer to the (string-based) command procedure that will be invoked; and <I>cmdClientData</I>, the client data that will be passed to the procedure.  The <I>objc</I> parameter is replaced with an <I>argv</I> parameter, that gives the arguments to the command as character strings. <I>Proc</I> must not modify the <I>command</I> or <I>argv</I> strings. <P>
If a trace created with <B>Tcl_CreateTrace</B> is in effect, inline compilation of Tcl commands such as <B>if</B> and <B>while</B> is always disabled.  There is no notification when a trace created with <B>Tcl_CreateTrace</B> is deleted. There is no way to be notified when the trace created by <B>Tcl_CreateTrace</B> is deleted.  There is no way for the <I>proc</I> associated with a call to <B>Tcl_CreateTrace</B> to abort execution of <I>command</I>. <P>
