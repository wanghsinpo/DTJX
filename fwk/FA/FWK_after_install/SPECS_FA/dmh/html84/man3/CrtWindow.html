<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The procedures <B>Tk_CreateWindow</B>, 
<B>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</B>, and <B>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</B>
are used to create new windows for
use in Tk-based applications.  Each of the procedures returns a token
that can be used to manipulate the window in other calls to the Tk
library.  If the window couldn't be created successfully, then NULL
is returned and <I>interp-&gt;result</I> is modified to hold an error
message.
<P>
Tk supports two different kinds of windows:  internal
windows and top-level windows.
An internal window is an interior window of a Tk application, such as a
scrollbar or menu bar or button.  A top-level window is one that is
created as a child of a screen's root window, rather than as an
interior window, but which is logically part of some existing main
window.  Examples of top-level windows are pop-up menus and dialog boxes.
<P>
New windows may be created by calling
<B>Tk_CreateWindow</B>.  If the <I>topLevScreen</I> argument is
NULL, then the new window will be an internal window.  If
<I>topLevScreen</I> is non-NULL, then the new window will be a
top-level window: <I>topLevScreen</I> indicates the name of
a screen and the new window will be created as a child of the
root window of <I>topLevScreen</I>.  In either case Tk will
consider the new window to be the logical child of <I>parent</I>:
the new window's path name will reflect this fact, options may
be specified for the new window under this assumption, and so on.
The only difference is that new X window for a top-level window
will not be a child of <I>parent</I>'s X window.  For example, a pull-down
menu's <I>parent</I> would be the button-like window used to invoke it,
which would in turn be a child of the menu bar window.  A dialog box might
have the application's main window as its parent.
<P>
<B>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</B> differs from <B>Tk_CreateWindow</B> in
that it creates an unnamed window.  This window will be manipulable
only using C interfaces, and will not be visible to Tcl scripts.  Both
interior windows and top-level windows may be created with
<B>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</B>.
<P>
<B>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</B> offers an alternate way of specifying
new windows.  In <B>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</B> the new
window is specified with a token for any window in the target
application (<I>tkwin</I>), plus a path name for the new window.
It produces the same effect as <B>Tk_CreateWindow</B> and allows
both top-level and internal windows to be created, depending on
the value of <I>topLevScreen</I>.  In calls to <B>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</B>,
as in calls to <B>Tk_CreateWindow</B>, the parent of the new window
must exist at the time of the call, but the new window must not
already exist.
<P>
The window creation procedures don't
actually issue the command to X to create a window.
Instead, they create a local data structure associated with
the window and defer the creation of the X window.
The window will actually be created by the first call to
<B>Tk_MapWindow</B>.  Deferred window creation allows various
aspects of the window (such as its size, background color,
etc.) to be modified after its creation without incurring
any overhead in the X server.  When the window is finally
mapped all of the window attributes can be set while creating
the window.
<P>
The value returned by a window-creation procedure is not the
X token for the window (it can't be, since X hasn't been
asked to create the window yet).  Instead, it is a token
for Tk's local data structure for the window.  Most
of the Tk library procedures take Tk_Window tokens, rather
than X identifiers.  The actual
X window identifier can be retrieved from the local
data structure using the <B>Tk_WindowId</B> macro;  see
the manual entry for <B>Tk_WindowId</B> for details.
<P>
<B>Tk_DestroyWindow</B> deletes a window and all the data
structures associated with it, including any event handlers
created with <B>Tk_CreateEventHandler</B>.  In addition,
<B>Tk_DestroyWindow</B> will delete any children of <I>tkwin</I>
recursively (where children are defined in the Tk sense, consisting
of all windows that were created with the given window as <I>parent</I>).
If <I>tkwin</I> is an internal window, then event
handlers interested in destroy events
are invoked immediately.  If <I>tkwin</I> is a top-level or main window,
then the event handlers will be invoked later, after X has seen
the request and returned an event for it.
<P>
If a window has been created
but hasn't been mapped, so no X window exists, it is
possible to force the creation of the X window by
calling <B>Tk_MakeWindowExist</B>.  This procedure issues
the X commands to instantiate the window given by <I>tkwin</I>.
