<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Tcl_Concat</B> is a utility procedure used by several of the
Tcl commands.  Given a collection of strings, it concatenates
them together into a single string, with the original strings
separated by spaces.  This procedure behaves differently than
<B>Tcl_Merge</B>, in that the arguments are simply concatenated:
no effort is made to ensure proper list structure.
However, in most common usage the arguments will all be proper
lists themselves;  if this is true, then the result will also have
proper list structure.
<P>
<B>Tcl_Concat</B> eliminates leading and trailing white space as it
copies strings from <B>argv</B> to the result.  If an element of
<B>argv</B> consists of nothing but white space, then that string
is ignored entirely.  This white-space removal was added to make
the output of the <B>concat</B> command cleaner-looking.
<P>
The result string is dynamically allocated
using <B>Tcl_Alloc</B>;  the caller must eventually release the space
by calling <B>Tcl_Free</B>.
