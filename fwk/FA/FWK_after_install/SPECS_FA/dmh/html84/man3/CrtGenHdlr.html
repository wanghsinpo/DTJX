<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</B> arranges for <I>proc</I> to be
invoked in the future whenever any X event occurs.  This mechanism is
<I>not</I> intended for dispatching X events on windows managed by Tk
(you should use <B>Tk_CreateEventHandler</B> for this purpose).
<B>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</B> is intended for other purposes, such
as tracing X events, monitoring events on windows not owned by Tk,
accessing X-related libraries that were not originally designed for
use with Tk, and so on.
<P>
The callback to <I>proc</I> will be made by <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B>;
this mechanism only works in programs that dispatch events
through <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B> (or through other Tk procedures that
call <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B>, such as <B>Tk_DoOneEvent</B> or
<B>Tk_MainLoop</B>).
<P>
<I>Proc</I> should have arguments and result that match the
type <B>Tk_GenericProc</B>:
<PRE>
typedef int Tk_GenericProc(
	ClientData <I>clientData</I>,
	XEvent *<I>eventPtr</I>);
</PRE>
The <I>clientData</I> parameter to <I>proc</I> is a copy of the <I>clientData</I> argument given to <B>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</B> when the callback was created.  Typically, <I>clientData</I> points to a data structure containing application-specific information about how to handle events. <I>EventPtr</I> is a pointer to the X event. <P>
Whenever an X event is processed by <B>Tk_HandleEvent</B>, <I>proc</I> is called.  The return value from <I>proc</I> is normally 0. A non-zero return value indicates that the event is not to be handled further; that is, <I>proc</I> has done all processing that is to be allowed for the event. <P>
If there are multiple generic event handlers, each one is called for each event, in the order in which they were established. <P>
<B>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler</B> may be called to delete a previously-created generic event handler:  it deletes each handler it finds that matches the <I>proc</I> and <I>clientData</I> arguments.  If no such handler exists, then <B>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler</B> returns without doing anything.  Although Tk supports it, it's probably a bad idea to have more than one callback with the same <I>proc</I> and <I>clientData</I> arguments. <P>
Establishing a generic event handler does nothing to ensure that the process will actually receive the X events that the handler wants to process. For example, it is the caller's responsibility to invoke <B>XSelectInput</B> to select the desired events, if that is necessary. <P>
