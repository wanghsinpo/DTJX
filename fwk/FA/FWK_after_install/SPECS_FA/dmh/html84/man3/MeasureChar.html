<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2>

<P><DT><B>Tk_Font <I>tkfont</I></B> (in)
<DD>Token for font in which text is to be drawn or measured.  Must have been
returned by a previous call to <B>Tk_GetFont</B>.
<P><DT><B>const char <I>*string</I></B> (in)
<DD>Text to be measured or displayed.  Need not be null terminated.  Any
non-printing meta-characters in the string (such as tabs, newlines, and
other control characters) will be measured or displayed in a
platform-dependent manner.  
<P><DT><B>int <I>numBytes</I></B> (in)
<DD>The maximum number of bytes to consider when measuring or drawing
<I>string</I>.  Must be greater than or equal to 0.
<P><DT><B>int <I>maxPixels</I></B> (in)
<DD>If <I>maxPixels</I> is &gt;= 0, it specifies the longest permissible
line length in pixels.  Characters from <I>string</I> are processed only
until this many pixels have been covered.  If <I>maxPixels</I> is &lt; 0, then
the line length is unbounded and the <I>flags</I> argument is ignored.
<P><DT><B>int <I>flags</I></B> (in)
<DD>Various flag bits OR-ed together: TK_PARTIAL_OK means include a character
as long as any part of it fits in the length given by <I>maxPixels</I>;
otherwise, a character must fit completely to be considered.
TK_WHOLE_WORDS means stop on a word boundary, if possible.  If
TK_AT_LEAST_ONE is set, it means return at least one character even if no
characters could fit in the length given by <I>maxPixels</I>.  If
TK_AT_LEAST_ONE is set and TK_WHOLE_WORDS is also set, it means that if
not even one word fits on the line, return the first few letters of the
word that did fit; if not even one letter of the word fit, then the first
letter will still be returned.
<P><DT><B>int <I>*lengthPtr</I></B> (out)
<DD>Filled with the number of pixels occupied by the number of characters
returned as the result of <B>Tk_MeasureChars</B>.
<P><DT><B>Display <I>*display</I></B> (in)
<DD>Display on which to draw.
<P><DT><B>Drawable <I>drawable</I></B> (in)
<DD>Window or pixmap in which to draw.
<P><DT><B>GC <I>gc</I></B> (in)
<DD>Graphics context for drawing characters.  The font selected into this GC 
must be the same as the <I>tkfont</I>.
<P><DT><B>int <I>"x,</I></B> (y" in)
<DD>Coordinates at which to place the left edge of the baseline when displaying
<I>string</I>.  
<P><DT><B>int <I>firstByte</I></B> (in)
<DD>The index of the first byte of the first character to underline in the
<I>string</I>.  Underlining begins at the left edge of this character.
<P><DT><B>int <I>lastByte</I></B> (in)
<DD>The index of the first byte of the last character up to which the
underline will be drawn.  The character specified by <I>lastByte</I>
will not itself be underlined.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
These routines are for measuring and displaying simple single-font,
single-line, strings.  To measure and display single-font, multi-line,
justified text, refer to the documentation for <B>Tk_ComputeTextLayout</B>.
There is no programming interface in the core of Tk that supports
multi-font, multi-line text; support for that behavior must be built on
top of simpler layers.  
Note that the interfaces described here are
byte-oriented not character-oriented, so index values coming from Tcl
scripts need to be converted to byte offsets using the
<B>Tcl_UtfAtIndex</B> and related routines.
<P>
A glyph is the displayable picture of a letter, number, or some other
symbol.  Not all character codes in a given font have a glyph.
Characters such as tabs, newlines/returns, and control characters that
have no glyph are measured and displayed by these procedures in a
platform-dependent manner; under X, they are replaced with backslashed
escape sequences, while under Windows and Macintosh hollow or solid boxes
may be substituted.  Refer to the documentation for
<B>Tk_ComputeTextLayout</B> for a programming interface that supports the
platform-independent expansion of tab characters into columns and
newlines/returns into multi-line text.  
<P>
<B>Tk_MeasureChars</B> is used both to compute the length of a given
string and to compute how many characters from a string fit in a given
amount of space.  The return value is the number of bytes from
<I>string</I> that fit in the space specified by <I>maxPixels</I> subject to
the conditions described by <I>flags</I>.  If all characters fit, the return
value will be <I>numBytes</I>.  <I>*lengthPtr</I> is filled with the computed
width, in pixels, of the portion of the string that was measured.  For
example, if the return value is 5, then <I>*lengthPtr</I> is filled with the
distance between the left edge of <I>string</I>[0] and the right edge of
<I>string</I>[4]. 
<P>
<B>Tk_TextWidth</B> is a wrapper function that provides a simpler interface
to the <B>Tk_MeasureChars</B> function.  The return value is how much
space in pixels the given <I>string</I> needs.
<P>
<B>Tk_DrawChars</B> draws the <I>string</I> at the given location in the
given <I>drawable</I>.
<P>
<B>Tk_UnderlineChars</B> underlines the given range of characters in the
given <I>string</I>.  It doesn't draw the characters (which are assumed to
have been displayed previously by <B>Tk_DrawChars</B>); it just draws the
underline.  This procedure is used to underline a few characters without
having to construct an underlined font.  To produce natively underlined
text, the appropriate underlined font should be constructed and used.
