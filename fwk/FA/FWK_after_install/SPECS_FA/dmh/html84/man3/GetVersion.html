<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Tcl_GetVersion</B> should be used to query the version number
of the Tcl library at runtime.  This is useful when using a 
dynamically loaded Tcl library or when writing a stubs-aware
extension.  For instance, if you write an extension that is
linked against the Tcl stubs library, it could be loaded into
a program linked to an older version of Tcl than you expected.
Use <B>Tcl_GetVersion</B> to verify that fact, and possibly to
change the behavior of your extension.
<P>
<B>Tcl_GetVersion</B> accepts NULL for any of the arguments. For instance if 
you do not care about the <I>patchLevel</I> of the library, pass
a NULL for the <I>patchLevel</I> argument.
