<DD>Pointer to X color information.  Must have been allocated by previous

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
These procedures manage the colors being used by a Tk application.
They allow colors to be shared whenever possible, so that colormap
space is preserved, and they pick closest available colors when
colormap space is exhausted.
<P>
Given a textual description of a color, <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B>
locates a pixel value that may be used to render the color
in a particular window.  The desired color is specified with an
object whose string value must have one of the following forms:

<DT><I>colorname</I>
<DD>Any of the valid textual names for a color defined in the server's color database file, such as <B>red</B> or <B>PeachPuff</B>. 
<DT><B>#<I>RGB</B></I>
<DD>
<DT><B>#<I>RRGGBB</B></I>
<DD>
<DT><B>#<I>RRRGGGBBB</B></I>
<DD>
<DT><B>#<I>RRRRGGGGBBBB</B></I>
<DD>A numeric specification of the red, green, and blue intensities to use to display the color.  Each <I>R</I>, <I>G</I>, or <I>B</I> represents a single hexadecimal digit.  The four forms permit colors to be specified with 4-bit, 8-bit, 12-bit or 16-bit values. When fewer than 16 bits are provided for each color, they represent the most significant bits of the color.  For example, #3a7 is the same as #3000a0007000. <P>
<B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B> returns a pointer to an XColor structure;  the structure indicates the exact intensities of the allocated color (which may differ slightly from those requested, depending on the limitations of the screen) and a pixel value that may be used to draw with the color in <I>tkwin</I>. If an error occurs in <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B> (such as an unknown color name) then NULL is returned and an error message is stored in <I>interp</I>'s result if <I>interp</I> isn't NULL. If the colormap for <I>tkwin</I> is full, <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B> will use the closest existing color in the colormap. <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B> caches information about the return value in <I>objPtr</I>, which speeds up future calls to procedures such as <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B> and <B>Tk_GetColorFromObj</B>. <P>
<B>Tk_GetColor</B> is identical to <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B> except that the description of the color is specified with a string instead of an object.  This prevents <B>Tk_GetColor</B> from caching the return value, so <B>Tk_GetColor</B> is less efficient than <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B>. <P>
<B>Tk_GetColorFromObj</B> returns the token for an existing color, given the window and description used to create the color. <B>Tk_GetColorFromObj</B> doesn't actually create the color; the color must already have been created with a previous call to <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B> or <B>Tk_GetColor</B>.  The return value is cached in <I>objPtr</I>, which speeds up future calls to <B>Tk_GetColorFromObj</B> with the same <I>objPtr</I> and <I>tkwin</I>. <P>
<B>Tk_GetColorByValue</B> is similar to <B>Tk_GetColor</B> except that the desired color is indicated with the <I>red</I>, <I>green</I>, and <I>blue</I> fields of the structure pointed to by <I>colorPtr</I>. <P>
This package maintains a database of all the colors currently in use. If the same color is requested multiple times from <B>Tk_GetColor</B> or <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B> (e.g. by different windows), or if the  same intensities are requested multiple times from <B>Tk_GetColorByValue</B>, then existing pixel values will be re-used.  Re-using an existing pixel avoids any interaction with the window server, which makes the allocation much more efficient.  These procedures also provide a portable interface that works across all platforms.  For this reason, you should generally use <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B>, <B>Tk_GetColor</B>, or <B>Tk_GetColorByValue</B> instead of lower level procedures like <B>XAllocColor</B>. <P>
Since different calls to this package may return the same shared pixel value, callers should never change the color of a pixel returned by the procedures. If you need to change a color value dynamically, you should use <B>XAllocColorCells</B> to allocate the pixel value for the color. <P>
The procedure <B>Tk_NameOfColor</B> is roughly the inverse of <B>Tk_GetColor</B>.  If its <I>colorPtr</I> argument was created by <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B> or <B>Tk_GetColor</B> then the return value is the string that was used to create the color.  If <I>colorPtr</I> was created by a call to <B>Tk_GetColorByValue</B>, or by any other mechanism, then the return value is a string that could be passed to <B>Tk_GetColor</B> to return the same color.  Note:  the string returned by <B>Tk_NameOfColor</B> is only guaranteed to persist until the next call to <B>Tk_NameOfColor</B>. <P>
<B>Tk_GCForColor</B> returns a graphics context whose <B>foreground</B> field is the pixel allocated for <I>colorPtr</I> and whose other fields all have default values. This provides an easy way to do basic drawing with a color. The graphics context is cached with the color and will exist only as long as <I>colorPtr</I> exists;  it is freed when the last reference to <I>colorPtr</I> is freed by calling <B>Tk_FreeColor</B>. <P>
When a color is no longer needed <B>Tk_FreeColorFromObj</B> or <B>Tk_FreeColor</B> should be called to release it. For <B>Tk_FreeColorFromObj</B> the color to release is specified with the same information used to create it; for <B>Tk_FreeColor</B> the color to release is specified with a pointer to its XColor structure. There should be exactly one call to <B>Tk_FreeColorFromObj</B> or <B>Tk_FreeColor</B> for each call to <B>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</B>, <B>Tk_GetColor</B>, or <B>Tk_GetColorByValue</B>. <P>
