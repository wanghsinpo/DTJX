<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P>
The Tcl stubs mechanism defines a way to dynamically bind
extensions to a particular Tcl implementation at run time.
the stubs mechanism requires no changes to applications
incoporating Tcl/Tk interpreters.  Only developers creating
C-based Tcl/Tk extensions need to take steps to use the
stubs mechanism with their extensions.
See the <B>Tcl_InitStubs</B> page for more information.
<P>
Enabling the stubs mechanism for a Tcl/Tk extension requires the following
steps:

<DT>1)
<DD>Call <B>Tcl_InitStubs</B> in the extension before calling any other Tcl functions. 
<DT>2)
<DD>Call <B>Tk_InitStubs</B> if the extension before calling any other Tk functions. 
<DT>2)
<DD>Define the USE_TCL_STUBS symbol.  Typically, you would include the -DUSE_TCL_STUBS flag when compiling the extension. 
<DT>3)
<DD>Link the extension with the Tcl and Tk stubs libraries instead of the standard Tcl and Tk libraries.  On Unix platforms, the library names are <I>libtclstub8.4.a</I> and <I>libtkstub8.4.a</I>; on Windows platforms, the library names are <I>tclstub84.lib</I> and <I>tkstub84.lib</I> (adjust names with appropriate version number). <P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <B>Tk_InitStubs</B> attempts to initialize the Tk stub table pointers and ensure that the correct version of Tk is loaded.  In addition to an interpreter handle, it accepts as arguments a version number and a Boolean flag indicating whether the extension requires an exact version match or not.  If <I>exact</I> is 0, then the extension is indicating that newer versions of Tk are acceptable as long as they have the same major version number as <I>version</I>; non-zero means that only the specified <I>version</I> is acceptable. <B>Tcl_InitStubs</B> returns a string containing the actual version of Tk satisfying the request, or NULL if the Tk version is not acceptable, does not support the stubs mechansim, or any other error condition occurred. <P>
