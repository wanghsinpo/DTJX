<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
This procedure may be invoked to announce that a package has been
linked statically with a Tcl application and, optionally, that it
has already been loaded into an interpreter.
Once <B>Tcl_StaticPackage</B> has been invoked for a package, it
may be loaded into interpreters using the <B>load</B> command.
<B>Tcl_StaticPackage</B> is normally invoked only by the <B>Tcl_AppInit</B>
procedure for the application, not by packages for themselves
(<B>Tcl_StaticPackage</B> should only be invoked for statically
loaded packages, and code in the package itself should not need
to know whether the package is dynamically or statically loaded).
<P>
When the <B>load</B> command is used later to load the package into
an interpreter, one of <I>initProc</I> and <I>safeInitProc</I> will
be invoked, depending on whether the target interpreter is safe
or not.
<I>initProc</I> and <I>safeInitProc</I> must both match the
following prototype:
<PRE>
typedef int Tcl_PackageInitProc(Tcl_Interp *<I>interp</I>);
</PRE>
The <I>interp</I> argument identifies the interpreter in which the package is to be loaded.  The initialization procedure must return <B>TCL_OK</B> or <B>TCL_ERROR</B> to indicate whether or not it completed successfully; in the event of an error it should set the interpreter's result to point to an error message.  The result or error from the initialization procedure will be returned as the result of the <B>load</B> command that caused the initialization procedure to be invoked. <P>
