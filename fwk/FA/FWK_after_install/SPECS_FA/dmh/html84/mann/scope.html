<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
Creates a scoped value for the specified <I>name</I>, which must be a variable name.  If the <I>name</I> is an instance variable, then the scope command returns a string of the following form: <PRE>
@itcl <I>object varName</I>
</PRE>
This is recognized in any context as an instance variable belonging to <I>object</I>.  So with itcl3.0 and beyond, it is possible to use instance variables in conjunction with widgets.  For example, if you have an object with a private variable x, and you can use x in conjunction with the -textvariable option of an entry widget.  Before itcl3.0, only common variables could be used in this manner. <P>
If the <I>name</I> is not an instance variable, then it must be a common variable or a global variable.  In that case, the scope command returns the fully qualified name of the variable, e.g., ::foo::bar::x. <P>
If the <I>name</I> is not recognized as a variable, the scope command returns an error. <P>
Ordinary variable names refer to variables in the global namespace. A scoped value captures a variable name together with its namespace context in a way that allows it to be referenced properly later. It is needed, for example, to wrap up variable names when a Tk widget is used within a namespace: <PRE>
namespace foo {
    private variable mode 1
<P>
    radiobutton .rb1 -text "Mode #1" \
        -variable [scope mode] -value 1
    pack .rb1
<P>
    radiobutton .rb2 -text "Mode #2" \
        -variable [scope mode] -value 2
    pack .rb2
}
</PRE>
Radiobuttons .rb1 and .rb2 interact via the variable "mode" contained in the namespace "foo".  The <B>scope</B> command guarantees this by returning the fully qualified variable name ::foo::mode. <P>
You should never use the @itcl syntax directly.  For example, it is a bad idea to write code like this: <PRE>
set {@itcl ::fred x} 3
puts "value = ${@itcl ::fred x}"
</PRE>
Instead, you should always use the scope command to generate the variable name dynamically.  Then, you can pass that name to a widget or to any other bit of code in your program. <P>
