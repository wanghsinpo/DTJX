<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>switch</B> command matches its <I>string</I> argument against each of the <I>pattern</I> arguments in order. As soon as it finds a <I>pattern</I> that matches <I>string</I> it evaluates the following <I>body</I> argument by passing it recursively to the Tcl interpreter and returns the result of that evaluation. If the last <I>pattern</I> argument is <B>default</B> then it matches anything. If no <I>pattern</I> argument matches <I>string</I> and no default is given, then the <B>switch</B> command returns an empty string. <P>
If the initial arguments to <B>switch</B> start with <B>-</B> then they are treated as options.  The following options are currently supported: 
<DT><B>-exact</B>
<DD>Use exact matching when comparing <I>string</I> to a pattern.  This is the default. 
<DT><B>-glob</B>
<DD>When matching <I>string</I> to the patterns, use glob-style matching (i.e. the same as implemented by the <B>string match</B> command). 
<DT><B>-regexp</B>
<DD>When matching <I>string</I> to the patterns, use regular expression matching (as described in the <B>re_syntax</B> reference page). 
<DT><B>--</B>
<DD>Marks the end of options.  The argument following this one will be treated as <I>string</I> even if it starts with a <B>-</B>. <P>
Two syntaxes are provided for the <I>pattern</I> and <I>body</I> arguments. The first uses a separate argument for each of the patterns and commands; this form is convenient if substitutions are desired on some of the patterns or commands. The second form places all of the patterns and commands together into a single argument; the argument must have proper list structure, with the elements of the list being the patterns and commands. The second form makes it easy to construct multi-line switch commands, since the braces around the whole list make it unnecessary to include a backslash at the end of each line. Since the <I>pattern</I> arguments are in braces in the second form, no command or variable substitutions are performed on them;  this makes the behavior of the second form different than the first form in some cases. <P>
If a <I>body</I> is specified as ``<B>-</B>'' it means that the <I>body</I> for the next pattern should also be used as the body for this pattern (if the next pattern also has a body of ``<B>-</B>'' then the body after that is used, and so on). This feature makes it possible to share a single <I>body</I> among several patterns. <P>
Beware of how you place comments in <B>switch</B> commands.  Comments should only be placed <B>inside</B> the execution body of one of the patterns, and not intermingled with the patterns. <P>
Below are some examples of <B>switch</B> commands: <PRE>
<B>switch abc a - b {format 1} abc {format 2} default {format 3}</B>
</PRE>
will return <B>2</B>,  <PRE>
<B>switch -regexp aaab {
	^a.*b$ -
	b {format 1}
	a* {format 2}
	default {format 3}
}</B>
</PRE>
will return <B>1</B>, and <PRE>
<B>switch xyz {
	a
		-
	b
		{
		# Correct Comment Placement
		format 1
	}
	a*
		{format 2}
	default
		{format 3}
}</B>
</PRE>
will return <B>3</B>. <P>
