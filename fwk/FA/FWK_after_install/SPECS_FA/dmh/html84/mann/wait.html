 wait - delay execution while dispatching events <P>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
 <B>dmh::wait <I>millisecs</B></I>  <P>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>wait</B> command is similar to the <B>after</B> command in that it is used to delay execution for a period specified in milliseconds. Unlike <B>after</B>,  the event loop processing of  the interpreter continues to dispatch events during the delay. For example, if you used <B>wait</B> to display a message  window for a specified period, the window would display correctly if it were resized, or moved.   <P>
As a design choice, it is preferable  to use the <B>after</B> command to execute code in the future than to  use <B>wait</B>.   This command is not part of the regular Tcl/Tk distribution; it has been added by Hume Integration Software. <P>
