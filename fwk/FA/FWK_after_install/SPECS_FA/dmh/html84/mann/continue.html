<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
This command is typically invoked inside the body of a looping command such as <B>for</B> or <B>foreach</B> or <B>while</B>. It returns a TCL_CONTINUE code, which causes a continue exception to occur. The exception causes the current script to be aborted out to the innermost containing loop command, which then continues with the next iteration of the loop. Catch exceptions are also handled in a few other situations, such as the <B>catch</B> command and the outermost scripts of procedure bodies. <P>
