<H2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS</H2>
 <P>

Name:	<B>alwaysQuery</B>
Class:	<B>AlwaysQuery</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-alwaysquery</B>
 
<DD> Boolean flag which tells the hierarchy widget weather or not each refresh of the display should be via a new query using the command value of the -querycommand option or use the values  previous found the last time the query was made.  The default is no. <P>

Name:	<B>closedIcon</B>
Class:	<B>Icon</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-closedicon</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the name of an existing closed icon image to be used in the  hierarchy before those nodes that are collapsed.  Should one not be  provided, then a folder icon will be generated, pixmap if possible,  bitmap otherwise. <P>

Name:	<B>dblClickCommand</B>
Class:	<B>Command</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-dblclickcommand</B>
 
<DD> Specifies a command to be executed upon user double clicking via mouse button one of the text label of an entry. If this command contains "%n", it is replaced with the name of the selected node. Should it contain "%s" then a boolean indicator of the node's current selection status is substituted. <P>

Name:	<B>expanded</B>
Class:	<B>Expanded</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-expanded</B>
 
<DD> When true, the hierarchy will be completely expanded when it is first displayed.  A fresh display can be triggered by resetting the -querycommand option.  The default is false. <P>

Name:	<B>filter</B>
Class:	<B>Filter</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-filter</B>
 
<DD> When true only the branch nodes and selected items are displayed. This gives a compact view of important items.  The default is false. <P>

Name:	<B>height</B>
Class:	<B>Height</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-height</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the height of the hierarchy as an entire unit. The value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to  <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>.  Any additional space needed to display the other components such as labels, margins, and scrollbars force the hierarchy to be compressed.  A value of zero along with the same value for  the width causes the value given for the visibleitems option  to be applied which administers geometry constraints in a different manner.  The default height is zero. <P>

Name:	<B>iconCommand</B>
Class:	<B>Command</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-iconcommand</B>
 
<DD> Specifies a command to be executed upon user selection via mouse button one of any additional icons given in the values returned by the command associated with the -querycommand option.  If this command contains "%n",  it is replaced with the name of the node the icon belongs to.  Should it  contain "%i" then the icon name is  substituted. <P>

Name:	<B>iconDblCommand</B>
Class:	<B>Command</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-icondblcommand</B>
 
<DD> Specifies a command to be executed upon user double clicking via mouse button one of the icon of an entry. If this command contains "%n", it is replaced with the name of the node the icon belongs to. Should it contain "%i" then the icon name is substituted. <P>

Name:	<B>imageCommand</B>
Class:	<B>Command</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-imagecommand</B>
 
<DD> Specifies a command to be executed upon user selecting an image of an entry. If this command contains "%n", it is replaced with the name of the selected node. Should it contain "%s" then a boolean indicator of the node's current selection status is substituted. <P>

Name:	<B>imageDblCommand</B>
Class:	<B>Command</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-imagedblcommand</B>
 
<DD> Specifies a command to be executed upon user double clicking via mouse button one of the image of an entry. If this command contains "%n", it is replaced with the name of the node the icon belongs to. Should it contain "%i" then the icon name is substituted. <P>

Name:	<B>imageMenuLoadCommand</B>
Class:	<B>Command</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-imagemenuloadcommand</B>
 
<DD> Specifies a command to be executed upon user selection via mouse button three, on the image or icon, that will dynamically load the itemMenu for the widget. <P>

Name:	<B>markBackground</B>
Class:	<B>Foreground</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-markbackground</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the background color to use when displaying marked nodes. <P>

Name:	<B>markForeground</B>
Class:	<B>Background</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-markforeground</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the foreground color to use when displaying marked nodes. <P>

Name:	<B>menuCursor</B>
Class:	<B>Cursor</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-menucursor</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the mouse cursor to be used for the item and background  menus.  The value may have any of the forms accept able to Tk_GetCursor. <P>

Name:	<B>nodeIcon</B>
Class:	<B>Icon</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-nodeicon</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the name of an existing node icon image to be used in the  hierarchy before those nodes that are leafs.  Should one not be provided,  then a dog-eared page icon will be generated, pixmap if possible, bitmap  otherwise. <P>

Name:	<B>openIcon</B>
Class:	<B>Icon</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-openicon</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the name of an existing open icon image to be used in the  hierarchy before those nodes that are expanded.  Should one not be provided,  then an open folder icon will be generated, pixmap if possible, bitmap  otherwise. <P>

Name:	<B>queryCommand</B>
Class:	<B>Command</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-querycommand</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the command executed to query the contents of each node.  If this  command contains "%n", it is replaced with the name of the desired  node.  In its simpilest form it should return the children of the  given node as a list which will be depicted in the display. Since the names of the children are used as tags in the underlying  text widget, each child must be unique in the hierarchy.  Due to the unique requirement, the nodes shall be reffered to as uids  or uid in the singular sense.  The format of returned list is 
<DD>   {uid [uid ...]} 
<DD>   where uid is a unique id and primary key for the hierarchy entry 
<DD> Should the unique requirement pose a problem, the list returned can take on another more extended form which enables the  association of text to be displayed with the uids.  The uid must still be unique, but the text does not have to obey the unique rule.  In addition, the format also allows the specification of additional tags to be used on the same entry in the hierarchy as the uid and additional icons to be displayed just before the node.  The tags and icons are considered to be the property of the user in that the hierarchy widget will not depend on any of  their values.  The extended format is 
<DD>   {{uid [text [tags [icons]]]} {uid [text [tags [icons]]]} ...} 
<DD>   where uid is a unique id and primary key for the hierarchy entry         text is the text to be displayed for this uid         tags is a list of user tags to be applied to the entry         icons is a list of icons to be displayed in front of the text 
<DD> The hierarchy widget does a look ahead from each node to determine if the node has a children.  This can be cost some performace with large hierarchies.  User's can avoid this by providing a hint in the user tags.  A tag of "leaf" or "branch" tells the hierarchy widget the information it needs to know thereby avoiding the look ahead operation. <P>

Name:	<B>hscrollMode</B>
Class:	<B>ScrollMode</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-hscrollmode</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the display mode to be used for the horizontal scrollbar: <B>static, dynamic,</B> or <B>none</B>.  In static mode, the  scroll bar is displayed at all times.  Dynamic mode displays the scroll bar as required, and none disables the scroll bar display.  The  default is static. <P>

Name:	<B>sbWidth</B>
Class:	<B>Width</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-sbwidth</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the width of the scrollbar in any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>.   <P>

Name:	<B>scrollMargin</B>
Class:	<B>Margin</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-scrollmargin</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the distance between the text portion of the hierarchy and  the scrollbars in any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>.  The  default is 3 pixels. <P>

Name:	<B>selectCommand</B>
Class:	<B>Command</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-selectcommand</B>
 
<DD> Specifies a Tcl command to be evaluated when you select a node in the hierarchy via left mouse click.  If "%n" is included in the command, it is substituted with the node name.  Similarly, "%s" is substituted with the node's current selection status: 1 for selected, 0 otherwise. <P>
Name:	<B>textBackground</B> Class:	<B>Background</B> Command-Line Switch:	<B>-textbackground</B>  
<DD> Specifies the background color for the text portion of the hierarchy in  any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetColor</B>. <P>

Name:	<B>textFont</B>
Class:	<B>Font</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-textfont</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the font to be used in the text portion of the hierarchy. <P>

Name:	<B>textMenuLoadCommand</B>
Class:	<B>Command</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-textmenuloadcommand</B>
 
<DD> Specifies a command to be executed upon user selection via mouse button three, that will dynamically load the itemMenu for the widget. <P>

Name:	<B>visibleitems</B>
Class:	<B>VisibleItems</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-visibleitems</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the widthxheight in characters and lines for the hierarchy. This option is only administered if the width and height options are both set to zero, otherwise they take precedence.  The default value is 80x24.  With the visibleitems option engaged, geometry constraints  are maintained only on the text portion of the hierarchy.  The size of  the other components such as  labels, margins, and scroll bars, are additive and independent,  effecting the overall size of the hierarchy.  In contrast, should the width and height options have non zero values, they are applied to the hierarchy as a whole.  The hierarchy  is compressed or expanded to maintain the geometry constraints. <P>

Name:	<B>vscrollMode</B>
Class:	<B>ScrollMode</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-vscrollmode</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the display mode to be used for the vertical scrollbar: <B>static, dynamic,</B> or <B>none</B>.  In static mode, the  scroll bar is displayed at all times.  Dynamic mode displays the  scroll bar as required, and none disables the scroll bar display.  The  default is static. <P>

Name:	<B>width</B>
Class:	<B>Width</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-width</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the width of the hierarchy as an entire unit. The value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to  <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>.  Any additional space needed to display the other components such as labels, margins, and scrollbars force the text portion of the hierarchy to be compressed.  A value of zero along with the same value for  the height causes the value given for the visibleitems option  to be applied which administers geometry constraints in a different manner.  The default width is zero. <P>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>iwidgets::hierarchy</B> command creates a hierarchical data view widget.   It allows the graphical management of a a list of nodes that can be expanded or collapsed.  Individual nodes can be highlighted. Clicking with the right mouse button on any item brings up a special item menu.  Clicking on the background area brings up a different popup menu.  Options exist to provide user control over the loading of the nodes and actions associated with node selection. Since the hierarchy is based on the scrolledtext widget, it includes options to control the method in which the scrollbars are displayed,  i.e. statically or  dynamically.  Options also exist for adding a  label to the hierarchy and controlling its position. <P>
<P>
<H2>METHODS</H2>
 <P>
The <B>iwidgets::hierarchy</B> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <I>pathName</I>.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form: <PRE>
<I>pathName option </I>?<I>arg arg ...</I>?
</PRE>
<I>Option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for hierarchy widgets: <P>

<H2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS</H2>
 
<DT><I>pathName <B>cget</B></I> <I>option</I>
<DD>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <I>option</I>. <I>Option</I> may have any of the values accepted by the <B>iwidgets::hierarchy</B> command. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>clear</B></I>
<DD>Removes all items from the hierarchy display including all tags and icons.   The display will remain empty until the -filter or -querycommand  options are set. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>collapse</B></I> <I>uid</I>
<DD>Collapses the hierarchy beneath the node with the specified unique id by  one level.  Since this can take a moment for large hierarchies, the  cursor will be changed to a watch during the collapse.  Also, if any of the nodes beneath the node being collapsed are selected, their status is changed to unselected. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>configure</B> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value option value ...</I>?
<DD>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <I>option</I> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options for <I>pathName</I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the format of this list).  If <I>option</I> is specified with no <I>value</I>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <I>option</I> is specified).  If one or more <I>option-value</I> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty string. <I>Option</I> may have any of the values accepted by the <B>iwidgets::hierarchy</B> command. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>current</B></I>
<DD>Returns the tags for the node that was most recently selected by the  right mouse button when the item menu was posted.  Usually used by the code in the item menu to figure out what item is being manipulated. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>draw</B></I> ?<I>when</I>?
<DD>Performs a complete redraw of the entire hierarchy.  When may be either -now or -eventually where the latter means the draw can be performed after idle. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>expand</B></I> <I>uid</I>
<DD>Expands the hierarchy beneath the node with the specified unique id by one level.  Since this can take a moment for large hierarchies, the cursor  will be changed to a watch during the expansion. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>expanded</B></I> <I>uid</I>
<DD>Returns the current state of expansion for the node with the specified unique id. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>expState</B></I>
<DD>Returns a list of all expanded nodes in the tree. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>mark</B></I> <I>option ?arg arg ...?</I>
<DD>This command is used to manipulate marks which is quite similar to  selection, adding a secondary means of hilighting an item in the  hierarchy.  The exact behavior of the command depends on the  <I>option</I> argument that follows the <B>mark</B> argument.  The  following forms of the command are currently supported: <DL>

<DT><I>pathName <B>mark clear</B></I>
<DD>Clears all the currently marked nodes in the hierarchy. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>mark add uid </B></I>?<I>uid uid ...</I>?
<DD>Marks the nodes with the specified uids in the hierarchy using the  <B>-markbackground</B> and <B>-markforeground</B> options and without affecting the mark state of any other nodes that were already  marked. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>mark remove uid </B></I>?<I>uid uid ...</I>?
<DD>Unmarks the nodes with the specified uids in the hierarchy without affecting the mark state of any other nodes that were already  marked. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>mark get</B></I>
<DD>Returns a list of the unique ids that are currently marked. </DL>

<DT><I>pathName <B>refresh</B></I> <I>uid</I>
<DD>Performs a redraw of a specific node that has the given uid.  If the node is not currently visible or in other words already drawn on the text, then no action is taken. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>prune</B></I> <I>uid</I>
<DD>Removes the node specified by the given uid from the hierarchy.  Should  the node have children, then all of its children will be removed as well. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>selection</B></I> <I>option </I>?<I>arg arg ...</I>?
<DD>This command is used to manipulate the selection of nodes in the hierarchy.  The exact behavior of the command depends on the  <I>option</I> argument that follows the <B>selection</B> argument.  The  following forms of the command are currently supported: <DL>

<DT><I>pathName <B>selection clear</B></I>
<DD>Clears all the currently selected nodes in the hierarchy. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>selection add uid </B></I>?<I>uid uid ...</I>?
<DD>Selects the nodes with the specified uids in the hierarchy using the  <B>-selectionbackground</B> and <B>-selectionforeground</B> options and without affecting the selection state of any other nodes that were already  selected. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>selection remove uid </B></I>?<I>uid uid ...</I>?
<DD>Deselects the nodes with the specified uids in the hierarchy without affecting the selection state of any other nodes that were already  selected. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>selection get</B></I>
<DD>Returns a list of the unique ids that are currently selected. </DL>
A nodes selection status is also dependent on it being visible.  If a  node is selected and its parent is then collapsed making the selected node not visible, then its selection status is changed to unselected. 
<DT><I>pathName <B>toggle</B></I> <I>uid</I>
<DD>Toggles the hierarchy beneath the node with the specified unique id.  If  the hierarchy is currently expanded, then it is collapsed, and vice-versa. <P>
