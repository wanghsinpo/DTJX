<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
Note: as of Tk 4.1 the <B>tkerror</B> command has been renamed to <B>bgerror</B> because the event loop (which is what usually invokes it) is now part of Tcl.  For backward compatibility the <B>bgerror</B> provided by the current Tk version still tries to call <B>tkerror</B> if there is one (or an auto loadable one),  so old script defining that error handler should still work, but you should anyhow modify your scripts to use <B>bgerror</B> instead  of <B>tkerror</B> because that support for the old name might vanish in the near future. If that call fails, <B>bgerror</B>  posts a dialog showing the error and offering to see the stack trace to the user. If you want your own error management you should directly override <B>bgerror</B> instead of <B>tkerror</B>. Documentation for <B>bgerror</B> is available as part of Tcl's documentation. <P>
