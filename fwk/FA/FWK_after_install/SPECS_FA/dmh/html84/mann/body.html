<H2>NAME</H2>
 body - change the body for a class method/proc <P>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
 <B>body <I>className::function args body</B></I> <HR>
<P>
<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>body</B> command is used outside of an <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> class definition to define or redefine the body of a class method or proc.  This facility allows a class definition to have separate "interface" and "implementation" parts. The "interface" part is a <B>class</B> command with declarations for methods, procs, instance variables and common variables. The "implementation" part is a series of <B>body</B> and <B>configbody</B> commands.  If the "implementation" part is kept in a separate file, it can be sourced again and again as bugs are fixed, to support interactive development. When using the "tcl" mode in the <B>emacs</B> editor, the "interface" and "implementation" parts can be kept in the same file; as bugs are fixed, individual bodies can be highlighted and sent to the test application. <P>
The name "<I>className<B>::function</B></I>" identifies the method/proc being changed. <P>
If an <I>args</I> list was specified when the <I>function</I> was defined in the class definition, the <I>args</I> list for the <B>body</B> command must match in meaning.  Variable names can change, but the argument lists must have the same required arguments and the same default values for optional arguments. The special <B>args</B> argument acts as a wildcard when included in the <I>args</I> list in the class definition; it will match zero or more arguments of any type when the body is redefined. <P>
If the <I>body</I> string starts with "<B>@</B>", it is treated as the symbolic name for a C procedure.  The <I>args</I> list has little meaning for the C procedure, except to document the expected usage.  (The C procedure is not guaranteed to use arguments in this manner.)  If <I>body</I> does not start with "<B>@</B>", it is treated as a Tcl command script.  When the function is invoked, command line arguments are matched against the <I>args</I> list, and local variables are created to represent each argument.  This is the usual behavior for a Tcl-style proc. <P>
Symbolic names for C procedures are established by registering procedures via <B>Itcl_RegisterC()</B>.  This is usually done in the <B>Tcl_AppInit()</B> procedure, which is automatically called when the interpreter starts up.  In the following example, the procedure My_FooCmd() is registered with the symbolic name "foo".  This procedure can be referenced in the <B>body</B> command as "@foo". <PRE>
int
Tcl_AppInit(interp)
    Tcl_Interp *interp;     /* Interpreter for application. */
{
    if (Itcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }
<P>
    if (Itcl_RegisterC(interp, "foo", My_FooCmd) != TCL_OK) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }
}
</PRE>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>
 In the following example, a "File" class is defined to represent open files.  The method bodies are included below the class definition via the <B>body</B> command.  Note that the bodies of the constructor/destructor must be included in the class definition, but they can be redefined via the <B>body</B> command as well. <PRE>
class File {
    private variable fid ""
    constructor {name access} {
        set fid [open $name $access]
    }
    destructor {
        close $fid
    }
<P>
    method get {}
    method put {line}
    method eof {}
}
<P>
body File::get {} {
    return [gets $fid]
}
body File::put {line} {
    puts $fid $line
}
body File::eof {} {
    return [::eof $fid]
}
<P>
#
# See the File class in action:
#
File x /etc/passwd "r"
while {![x eof]} {
    puts "=&gt; [x get]"
}
delete object x
