<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>find</B> command is used to find classes and objects that are available in the current interpreter.  Classes and objects are reported first in the active namespace, then in all other namespaces in the interpreter. <P>
The <I>option</I> argument determines what action is carried out by the command.  The legal <I>options</I> (which may be abbreviated) are: 
<DT><B>find classes ?<I>pattern</B></I>?
<DD>Returns a list of [incr Tcl] classes.  Classes in the current namespace are listed first, followed by classes in all other namespaces in the interpreter.  If the optional <I>pattern</I> is specified, then the reported names are compared using the rules of the "<B>string match</B>" command, and only matching names are reported. <P>
If a class resides in the current namespace context, this command reports its simple name--without any qualifiers.  However, if the <I>pattern</I> contains <B>::</B> qualifiers, or if the class resides in another context, this command reports its fully-qualified name. Therefore, you can use the following command to obtain a list where all names are fully-qualified: <PRE>
find classes ::*
</PRE>

<DT><B>find objects ?<I>pattern</B></I>? ?<B>-class <I>className</B></I>? ?<B>-isa <I>className</B></I>?
<DD>Returns a list of [incr Tcl] objects.  Objects in the current namespace are listed first, followed by objects in all other namespaces in the interpreter.  If the optional <I>pattern</I> is specified, then the reported names are compared using the rules of the "<B>string match</B>" command, and only matching names are reported. If the optional "<B>-class</B>" parameter is specified, this list is restricted to objects whose most-specific class is <I>className</I>. If the optional "<B>-isa</B>" parameter is specified, this list is further restricted to objects having the given <I>className</I> anywhere in their heritage. <P>
If an object resides in the current namespace context, this command reports its simple name--without any qualifiers.  However, if the <I>pattern</I> contains <B>::</B> qualifiers, or if the object resides in another context, this command reports its fully-qualified name. Therefore, you can use the following command to obtain a list where all names are fully-qualified: <PRE>
find objects ::*
