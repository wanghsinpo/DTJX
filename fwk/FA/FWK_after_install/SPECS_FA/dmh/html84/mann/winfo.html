<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>winfo</B> command is used to retrieve information about windows managed by Tk.  It can take any of a number of different forms, depending on the <I>option</I> argument.  The legal forms are: 
<DT><B>winfo atom </B>?<B>-displayof <I>window</B></I>? <I>name</I>
<DD>Returns a decimal string giving the integer identifier for the atom whose name is <I>name</I>.  If no atom exists with the name <I>name</I> then a new one is created. If the <B>-displayof</B> option is given then the atom is looked up on the display of <I>window</I>;  otherwise it is looked up on the display of the application's main window. 
<DT><B>winfo atomname </B>?<B>-displayof <I>window</B></I>? <I>id</I>
<DD>Returns the textual name for the atom whose integer identifier is <I>id</I>. If the <B>-displayof</B> option is given then the identifier is looked up on the display of <I>window</I>;  otherwise it is looked up on the display of the application's main window. This command is the inverse of the <B>winfo atom</B> command. It generates an error if no such atom exists. 
<DT><B>winfo cells <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a decimal string giving the number of cells in the color map for <I>window</I>. 
<DT><B>winfo children <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a list containing the path names of all the children of <I>window</I>. Top-level windows are returned as children of their logical parents. The list is in stacking order, with the lowest window first, except for Top-level windows which are not returned in stacking order. Use the <B>wm stackorder</B> command to query the stacking order of Top-level windows. 
<DT><B>winfo class <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns the class name for <I>window</I>. 
<DT><B>winfo colormapfull <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns 1 if the colormap for <I>window</I> is known to be full, 0 otherwise.  The colormap for a window is ``known'' to be full if the last attempt to allocate a new color on that window failed and this application hasn't freed any colors in the colormap since the failed allocation. 
<DT><B>winfo containing </B>?<B>-displayof <I>window</B></I>? <I>rootX rootY</I>
<DD>Returns the path name for the window containing the point given by <I>rootX</I> and <I>rootY</I>. <I>RootX</I> and <I>rootY</I> are specified in screen units (i.e. any form acceptable to <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>) in the coordinate system of the root window (if a virtual-root window manager is in use then the coordinate system of the virtual root window is used). If the <B>-displayof</B> option is given then the coordinates refer to the screen containing <I>window</I>;  otherwise they refer to the screen of the application's main window. If no window in this application contains the point then an empty string is returned. In selecting the containing window, children are given higher priority than parents and among siblings the highest one in the stacking order is chosen. 
<DT><B>winfo depth <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a decimal string giving the depth of <I>window</I> (number of bits per pixel). 
<DT><B>winfo exists <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns 1 if there exists a window named <I>window</I>, 0 if no such window exists. 
<DT><B>winfo fpixels <I>window</B></I> <I>number</I>
<DD>Returns a floating-point value giving the number of pixels in <I>window</I> corresponding to the distance given by <I>number</I>. <I>Number</I> may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetScreenMM</B>, such as ``2.0c'' or ``1i''. The return value may be fractional;  for an integer value, use <B>winfo pixels</B>. 
<DT><B>winfo geometry <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns the geometry for <I>window</I>, in the form <I>width<B>xheight+x+y</B></I>.  All dimensions are in pixels. 
<DT><B>winfo height <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a decimal string giving <I>window</I>'s height in pixels. When a window is first created its height will be 1 pixel;  the height will eventually be changed by a geometry manager to fulfill the window's needs. If you need the true height immediately after creating a widget, invoke <B>update</B> to force the geometry manager to arrange it, or use <B>winfo reqheight</B> to get the window's requested height instead of its actual height. 
<DT><B>winfo id <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a hexadecimal string giving a low-level platform-specific identifier for <I>window</I>.  On Unix platforms, this is the X window identifier.  Under Windows, this is the Windows HWND.  On the Macintosh the value has no meaning outside Tk. 
<DT><B>winfo interps </B>?<B>-displayof <I>window</B></I>?
<DD>Returns a list whose members are the names of all Tcl interpreters (e.g. all Tk-based applications) currently registered for a particular display. If the <B>-displayof</B> option is given then the return value refers to the display of <I>window</I>;  otherwise it refers to the display of the application's main window. 
<DT><B>winfo ismapped <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns <B>1</B> if <I>window</I> is currently mapped, <B>0</B> otherwise. 
<DT><B>winfo manager <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns the name of the geometry manager currently responsible for <I>window</I>, or an empty string if <I>window</I> isn't managed by any geometry manager. The name is usually the name of the Tcl command for the geometry manager, such as <B>pack</B> or <B>place</B>. If the geometry manager is a widget, such as canvases or text, the name is the widget's class command, such as <B>canvas</B>. 
<DT><B>winfo name <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns <I>window</I>'s name (i.e. its name within its parent, as opposed to its full path name). The command <B>winfo name .</B> will return the name of the application. 
<DT><B>winfo parent <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns the path name of <I>window</I>'s parent, or an empty string if <I>window</I> is the main window of the application. 
<DT><B>winfo pathname </B>?<B>-displayof <I>window</B></I>? <I>id</I>
<DD>Returns the path name of the window whose X identifier is <I>id</I>. <I>Id</I> must be a decimal, hexadecimal, or octal integer and must correspond to a window in the invoking application. If the <B>-displayof</B> option is given then the identifier is looked up on the display of <I>window</I>;  otherwise it is looked up on the display of the application's main window. 
<DT><B>winfo pixels <I>window</B></I> <I>number</I>
<DD>Returns the number of pixels in <I>window</I> corresponding to the distance given by <I>number</I>. <I>Number</I> may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>, such as ``2.0c'' or ``1i''. The result is rounded to the nearest integer value;  for a fractional result, use <B>winfo fpixels</B>. 
<DT><B>winfo pointerx <I>window</B></I>
<DD>If the mouse pointer is on the same screen as <I>window</I>, returns the pointer's x coordinate, measured in pixels in the screen's root window. If a virtual root window is in use on the screen, the position is measured in the virtual root. If the mouse pointer isn't on the same screen as <I>window</I> then -1 is returned. 
<DT><B>winfo pointerxy <I>window</B></I>
<DD>If the mouse pointer is on the same screen as <I>window</I>, returns a list with two elements, which are the pointer's x and y coordinates measured in pixels in the screen's root window. If a virtual root window is in use on the screen, the position is computed in the virtual root. If the mouse pointer isn't on the same screen as <I>window</I> then both of the returned coordinates are -1. 
<DT><B>winfo pointery <I>window</B></I>
<DD>If the mouse pointer is on the same screen as <I>window</I>, returns the pointer's y coordinate, measured in pixels in the screen's root window. If a virtual root window is in use on the screen, the position is computed in the virtual root. If the mouse pointer isn't on the same screen as <I>window</I> then -1 is returned. 
<DT><B>winfo reqheight <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a decimal string giving <I>window</I>'s requested height, in pixels.  This is the value used by <I>window</I>'s geometry manager to compute its geometry. 
<DT><B>winfo reqwidth <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a decimal string giving <I>window</I>'s requested width, in pixels.  This is the value used by <I>window</I>'s geometry manager to compute its geometry. 
<DT><B>winfo rgb <I>window color</B></I>
<DD>Returns a list containing three decimal values, which are the red, green, and blue intensities that correspond to <I>color</I> in the window given by <I>window</I>.  <I>Color</I> may be specified in any of the forms acceptable for a color option. 
<DT><B>winfo rootx <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a decimal string giving the x-coordinate, in the root window of the screen, of the upper-left corner of <I>window</I>'s border (or <I>window</I> if it has no border). 
<DT><B>winfo rooty <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a decimal string giving the y-coordinate, in the root window of the screen, of the upper-left corner of <I>window</I>'s border (or <I>window</I> if it has no border). 
<DT><B>winfo screen <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns the name of the screen associated with <I>window</I>, in the form <I>displayName</I>.<I>screenIndex</I>. 
<DT><B>winfo screencells <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a decimal string giving the number of cells in the default color map for <I>window</I>'s screen. 
<DT><B>winfo screendepth <I>window</B></I>

<DT><B>winfo server <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a string containing information about the server for <I>window</I>'s display.  The exact format of this string may vary from platform to platform.  For X servers the string has the form ``<B>X<I>majorRminor vendor vendorVersion</B></I>'' where <I>major</I> and <I>minor</I> are the version and revision numbers provided by the server (e.g., <B>X11R5</B>), <I>vendor</I> is the name of the vendor for the server, and <I>vendorRelease</I> is an integer release number provided by the server. 
<DT><B>winfo toplevel <I>window</B></I>

<DT><B>winfo visualsavailable <I>window</B></I> ?<B>includeids</B>?
<DD>Returns a list whose elements describe the visuals available for <I>window</I>'s screen. Each element consists of a visual class followed by an integer depth. The class has the same form as returned by <B>winfo visual</B>. The depth gives the number of bits per pixel in the visual. In addition, if the <B>includeids</B> argument is provided, then the depth is followed by the X identifier for the visual. 
<DT><B>winfo vrootheight <I>window</B></I>

When a window is first created its width will be 1 pixel;  the width will eventually be changed by a geometry manager to fulfill the window's needs. If you need the true width immediately after creating a widget, invoke <B>update</B> to force the geometry manager to arrange it, or use <B>winfo reqwidth</B> to get the window's requested width instead of its actual width. 
<DT><B>winfo x <I>window</B></I>
<DD>Returns a decimal string giving the x-coordinate, in <I>window</I>'s parent, of the upper-left corner of <I>window</I>'s border (or <I>window</I> if it has no border).
