<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
This command is used to play a datafile representing sound.
Typically .wav and .mp3 file types are supported.  The pathname
should be delimited with Unix style slashes.  On windows, backslashes
can be used if they are doubled in order to escape their meaning
as special characters.  
<P>
On the
windows platform, the command invokes the default Open action
by exec'ing the command processor with the pathname as a background
process.  This technique
relies on having the Windows media player installed, or a suitable
third party program such as <A href="http://www.winamp.com/">winamp</A>,
or <A href="http://www.musicmatch.com/">MusicMatch Jukebox</A> installed
and associated with the sound file extensions.
<P>
On the Linux and POSIX platforms, the command invokes <B>esdplay</B>
to play .wav files, and <B>mpg123</B> to play .mp3 files.  If you have
different software installed, you can create shell scripts with these
names to invoke your own programs.
<P>
The command is part of the <B>Humelib</B> package and can be 
imported from the namespace <B>humelib</B>.
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>
