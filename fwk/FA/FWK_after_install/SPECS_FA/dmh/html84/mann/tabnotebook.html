<DD> For horizontally positioned tabs (<B>tabpos</B> is either <B>s</B> or <B>n</B>), <B>true</B> forces all tabs to be equal width (the width being equal to  the longest label plus any <B>padX</B> specified). Horizontal tabs are  always equal in height.  
<DD> For vertically positioned tabs (<B>tabpos</B> is either <B>w</B> or <B>e</B>),  <B>true</B> forces all tabs to be equal height (the height being equal to the  height of the label with the largest font). Vertically oriented tabs  are always equal in width. <P>

Name:	<B>foreground</B>
Class:	<B>Foreground</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-foreground</B>

A value of <B>true</B> says to  raise selected tabs, a value of <B>false</B> turns this feature off. The  default is <B>false</B>. The value may have any of the forms accepted  by the <B>Tcl_GetBoolean</B>, such as <B>true</B>, <B>false</B>, <B>0</B>,  <B>1</B>, <B>yes</B>, or <B>no</B>. <P>

Name:	<B>start</B>
Class:	<B>Start</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-start</B>
 
<DD> Specifies the amount of space to place between the left or top edge of the  tabnotebook and the starting edge of its tabs. For horizontally positioned  tabs, this is the amount of space between the left edge of the notebook and  the left edge of the first tab. For vertically positioned tabs, this is the  amount of space between the top of the notebook and the top of the first  tab. This value may change if the user performs a MButton-2 scroll on the  tabs. This value may have any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>. <P>

Name:	<B>state</B>

<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>iwidgets::tabnotebook</B> command creates a new window (given by the pathName  argument) and makes it into a <B>tabnotebook</B> widget. Additional options,  described above may be specified on the command line or in the option  database to configure aspects of the tabnotebook such as its colors, font,  and text. The iwidgets::tabnotebook command returns its pathName argument. At the  time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named  pathName, but pathName's parent must exist. <P>
A <B>tabnotebook</B> is a widget that contains a set of tabbed pages. It  displays one page from the set as the selected page. A Tab displays the  label for the page to which it is attached and serves as a page  selector. When a page's tab is selected, the page's contents are displayed  in the page area. The selected tab has a three-dimensional effect to make  it appear to float above the other tabs. The tabs are displayed as a group  along either the left, top, right, or bottom edge. When first created a  tabnotebook has no pages. Pages may be added or deleted using widget  commands described below. <P>
A special option may be provided to the tabnotebook. The <B>-auto</B>  option specifies whether the tabnotebook will automatically handle the  unpacking and packing of pages when pages are selected. A value of  true signifies that the notebook will automatically manage it. This is the  default value. A value of false signifies the notebook will not perform  automatic switching of pages. <P>
<H2>NOTEBOOK PAGES</H2>
 A tabnotebook's pages area contains a single child site frame. When a  new page is created it is a child of this frame. The page's child site  frame serves as a geometry container for applications to pack widgets  into. It is this frame that is automatically unpacked or packed when  the auto option is true. This creates the effect of one page being visible  at a time. When a new page is selected, the previously selected page's  child site frame is automatically unpacked from the tabnotebook's child  site frame and the newly selected page's child site is packed into the  tabnotebook's child site frame. <P>
However, sometimes it is desirable to handle page changes in a different  manner. By specifying the <B>auto</B> option as <B>false</B>, child site  packing can be disabled and done differently. For example, all widgets  might be packed into the first page's child site <B>frame</B>. Then when  a new page is selected, the application can reconfigure the widgets  and give the appearance that the page was flipped. <P>
In both cases the command option for a page specifies a Tcl Command  to execute when the page is selected. In the case of <B>auto</B>  being <B>true</B>, it is between the unpacking of the previously selected  page and the packing of the newly selected page. <P>
Notebook pages can also be controlled with scroll bars or other widgets  that obey the <B>scrollcommand</B> protocol. By giving a scrollbar  a <B>-command</B> to call the tabnotebook's <B>select</B> method, the  tabnotebook can be controlled with a scrollbar. <P>
The notebook area is implemented with the notebook mega widget. <P>
<H2>TABS</H2>
 Tabs appear along the edge of the notebook area. Tabs are drawn to appear  attached to their associated page. When a tab is clicked on, the associated  page is selected and the tab is drawn as raised above all other tabs and as  a seamless part of its notebook page. Tabs can be controlled in their  location along the edges, the angle tab sides are drawn with, gap between  tabs, starting margin of tabs, internal padding around text labels in  a tab, the font, and its label.  <P>
The Tab area is implemented with the <B>tabset</B> mega widget.  See <B>tabset(1)</B>. Tabs may be oriented along either the north, south,  east, or west sides with the <B>tabPos</B> option. North and south tabs  may appear as angled, square, or bevelled. West and east tabs may appear  as square or bevelled. By changing tab gaps, tab angles, bevelling,  orientations, colors, fonts, start locations, and margins; tabs may appear  in a wide variety of styles. For example, it is possible to implement  Microsoft-style tabs, Borland property tab styles, or Borland Delphi  style tabs all with the same tabnotebook. <P>
<H2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS</H2>
 <P>
The <B>iwidgets::tabnotebook</B> command creates a new Tcl command whose name  is <I>pathName</I>. This command may be used to invoke various operations  on the widget. It has the following general form: <PRE>
<I>pathName option </I>?<I>arg arg ...</I>?
</PRE>
<I>option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s determine the exact behavior of the command. <P>
Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argument an  indicator of which page of the notebook to operate on. These indicators are  called indexes and may be specified in any of the following forms: 
<DT><I>number</I>
<DD>Specifies the page numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first page  in the notebook, 1 to the second, and so on. 
<DT><B>select</B>
<DD>Specifies the currently selected page's index. If no page is currently  selected, the value -1 is returned. 
<DT><B>end</B>
<DD>Specifes the last page in the tabnotebook's index. If the notebook is empty  this will return -1. 
<DT><I>pattern</I>
<DD>If the index doesn't satisfy any of the above forms, then this form is  used. Pattern is pattern-matched against the label of each page in the  notebook, in order from the first to the last page, until a matching entry  is found. The rules of Tcl_StringMatch are used. The following commands are possible for tabnotebook widgets: 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>add</B> ?<I>option</I> <I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
<DD>Add a new page at the end of the tabnotebook. A new child site frame is  created. Returns the child site pathName. If additional arguments are  present, they specify any of the following options: <DL>

<DT><B>-angle</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifes the angle of slope from the inner edge to the outer edge of the  tab. An angle of 0 specifies square tabs. Valid ranges are 0 to 45 degrees  inclusive. Default is 15 degrees. If this option is specified as an empty  string (the default), then the angle option for the overall tabnotebook  is used. This is generally only set at the tabnotebook level. Tabs normally  will want to share the same angle value. 
<DT><B>-background</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies a background color to use for displaying tabs when they are  selected and for displaying the current page. If this option is specified  as an empty string (the default), then the background option for the  overall tabnotebook is used. 
<DT><B>-bevelamount</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifes the size of tab corners. A value of 0 with angle set to 0  results in square tabs. A bevelAmount of 4, means that the tab will be  drawn with angled corners that cut in 4 pixels from the edge of the tab.  The default is 0. This is generally only set at the tabnotebook level.  Tabs normally will want to share the same bevelAmount. 
<DT><B>-bitmap</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>If label is a non-empty string, specifies a bitmap to display in this  page's tab. Bitmap may be of any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetPixmap.  
<DT><B>-command</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies a Tcl command to be executed when this page is selected. This  allows the programmer a hook to reconfigure this page's widgets or any  other page's widgets. 
<DD> If the tabnotebook has the auto option set to true, when a page is  selected this command will be called immediately after the previously  selected page is unpacked and immediately before this page is selected. The  index value select is valid during this Tcl command. `index select' will  return this page's page number.  
<DD> If the auto option is set to false, when a page is selected the unpack  and pack calls are bypassed. This Tcl command is still called. 
<DT><B>-disabledforeground</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab labels when tabs  are in their disable state. If this option is specified as an empty  string (the default), then the disabledforeground option for the overall  tabnotebook is used. 
<DT><B>-font</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies the font to use when drawing a text label on a page tab. If  this option is specified as an empty string then the font option for the  overall tabnotebook is used.. 
<DT><B>-foreground</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab labels when they are  selected. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default),  then the foreground option for the overall tabnotebook is used. 
<DT><B>-label</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies a string to display as an identifying label for a notebook  page. This label serves as an additional identifier used to reference the  page. This label may be used for the index value in widget commands. 
<DT><B>-tabbackground</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies a background color to use for displaying a tab when it is not  elected. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), then  the tabBackground option for the overall tabnotebook is used. 
<DT><B>-tabforeground</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying the tab's text label  when it is not selected. If this option is specified as an empty  string (the default), then the tabForeground option for the overall  tabnotebook is used. 
<DT><B>-padx</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to request  for a tab around its label in the X-direction. When computing how large a  window it needs, the tab will add this amount to the width it would  normally need The tab will end up with extra internal space to the  left and right of its text label. This value may have any of the forms  acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is specified as an empty  string (the default), then the padX option for the overall tabnotebook is used 
<DT><B>-pady</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to request  for a tab around its label in the Y-direction. When computing how large  a window it needs, the tab will add this amount to the height it would  normally need The tab will end up with extra internal space to the top and  bottom of its text label. This value may have any of the forms acceptable  to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is specified as an empty string (the  default), then the padY option for the overall tabnotebook is used 
<DT><B>-state</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Specifies one of two states for the page: normal or disabled. In normal state  unselected tabs are displayed using the tabforeground and tabbackground  option from the tabnotebook or the page. Selected tabs and pages are  displayed using the foreground and background option from the tabnotebook or  the page. The disabled state means that the page and its tab is  insensitive: it doesn't respond to mouse button presses or releases. In this  state the entry is displayed according to its disabledForeground option for  the tabnotebook and the background/tabbackground option from the page or  the tabnotebook. </DL>

<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>childSite</B> ?<I>index</I>?
<DD>If passed no arguments, returns a list of pathNames for all the pages  in the tabnotebook. If the tab notebook is empty, an empty list is returned 
<DD> If <I>index</I> is passed, it returns the <I>pathName</I> for the page's  child site <B>frame</B> specified by <I>index</I>. Widgets that are created  with this <I>pathName</I> will be displayed when the associated page is  selected. If <I>index</I> is not a valid index, an empty string is returned.  
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>configure</B> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
<DD>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <I>option</I>  is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options  for <I>pathName</I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the  format of this list). If option is specified with no value, then the  command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be  identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option  is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are specified, then the  command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in  this case the command returns an empty string. <I>Option</I> may have any  of the values accepted by the iwidgets::tabnotebook command. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <I>index1</I> ?<I>index2</I>?
<DD>Delete all of the pages between <I>index1</I> and <I>index2</I> inclusive.  If <I>index2</I> is omitted then it defaults to <I>index1</I>. Returns an  empty string. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>index</B> <I>index</I>
<DD>Returns the numerical index corresponding to <I>index</I>. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>insert</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I> <I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
<DD>Insert a new page in the tabnotebook before the page specified  by <I>index</I>. A new child site <B>frame</B> is created. The additional  arguments are the same as for the <B>add</B> command. Returns the  child site <I>pathName</I>. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>next</B>
<DD>Advances the selected page to the next page (order is determined by  insertion order). If the currently selected page is the last page in  the notebook, the selection wraps around to the first page in the  notebook. It behaves as if the user selected the new page. 
<DD> For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>true</B> the current page's  child site is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the next  page's child site is packed into the notebook's child site frame. The  Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked between these  two operations. 
<DD> For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>false</B> the Tcl command given  with the command option will be invoked. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>pageconfigure</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
<DD>This command is similar to the <B>configure</B> command, except that it  applies to the options for an individual page, whereas configure applies  to the options for the tabnotebook as a whole. <I>Options</I> may have  any of the values accepted by the add widget command. If options are  specified, options are modified as indicated in the command and the  command returns an empty string. If no options are specified, returns a  list describing the current options for page index (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the format of this list). 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>prev</B>
<DD>Moves the selected page to the previous page (order is determined by  insertion order). If the currently selected page is the first page in  the notebook, the selection wraps around to the last page in the notebook. It  behaves as if the user selected the new page. 
<DD> For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>true</B> the current page's  child site is unpacked from the notebook's child site <B>frame</B>. Then the  previous page's child site is packed into the notebook's child site frame.  The Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked between these  two operations. 
<DD> For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>false</B> the Tcl command given  with the command option will be invoked. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>select</B> <I>index</I>
<DD>Selects the page specified by <I>index</I> as the currently selected page.  It behaves as if the user selected the new page. 
<DD> For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>true</B> the current page's child  site is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the <I>index</I>  page's child site is packed into the notebook's child site frame. The  Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked between these two  operations. 
<DD> For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>false</B> the Tcl command given  with the command option will be invoked. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>view</B>
<DD>Returns the currently selected page. This command is for compatibility with  the <B>scrollbar</B> widget. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>view</B> <I>index</I>
<DD>Selects the page specified by <I>index</I> as the currently selected page.  This command is for compatibility with the <B>scrollbar</B> widget. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>view</B> <B>moveto</B> <I>fraction</I>
<DD>Uses the <I>fraction</I> value to determine the corresponding page to move to.  This command is for compatibility with the <B>scrollbar</B> widget. 
<DT><I>pathName</I> <B>view</B> <B>scroll</B> <I>num</I> <I>what</I>
<DD>Uses the <I>num</I> value to determine how many pages to move forward or  backward (<I>num</I> can be negative or positive). The <I>what</I> argument  is ignored. This command is for compatibility with the <B>scrollbar</B> widget. <P>
<H2>COMPONENTS</H2>
