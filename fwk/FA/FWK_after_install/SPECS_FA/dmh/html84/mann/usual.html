 usual - access default option-handling commands <BR>
	for a mega-widget component <P>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
 <B>usual ?<I>tag</B></I>? ?<I>commands</I>? <HR>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>usual</B> command is used outside of an <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> class definition to define the usual set of option-handling commands for a component widget.  Option-handling commands are used when a component is registered with the <B>Archetype</B> base class via the "<B>itk_component add</B>" method.  They specify how the component's configuration options should be integrated into the composite option list for the mega-widget. Options can be kept, renamed, or ignored, as described in the <B>Archetype</B> man page. <P>
It is tedious to include the same declarations again and again whenever components are added.  The <B>usual</B> command allows a standard code fragment to be registered for each widget class, which is used by default to handle the options.  All of the standard Tk widgets have <B>usual</B> declarations defined in the <B>[incr&nbsp;Tk]</B> library.  Similar <B>usual</B> declarations should be created whenever a new mega-widget class is conceived. Only the most-generic options should be included in the <B>usual</B> declaration. <P>
The <I>tag</I> name is usually the name of a widget class, which starts with a capital letter; however, any string registered here can be used later with the <B>usual</B> command described on the <B>Archetype</B> man page. <P>
If the <I>commands</I> argument is specified, it is associated with the <I>tag</I> string, and can be accessed later via <B>itk_component add</B>. <P>
If only the <I>tag</I> argument is specified, this command looks for an existing <I>tag</I> name and returns the commands associated with it.  If there are no commands associated with <I>tag</I>, this command returns the null string. <P>
If no arguments are specified, this command returns a list of all <I>tag</I> names previously registered. <P>
<P>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>
 Following is the <B>usual</B> declaration for the standard Tk button widget: <PRE>
usual Button {
    keep -background -cursor -foreground -font
    keep -activebackground -activeforeground -disabledforeground
    keep -highlightcolor -highlightthickness
    rename -highlightbackground -background background Background
}
</PRE>
Only the options that would be common to all buttons in a single mega-widget are kept or renamed.  Options like "-text" that would be unique to a particular button are ignored. <P>
