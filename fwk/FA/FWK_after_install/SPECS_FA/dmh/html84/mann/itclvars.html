<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The following global variables are created and managed automatically by the <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> library.  Except where noted below, these variables should normally be treated as read-only by application-specific code and by users. 
<DT><B>itcl::library</B>
<DD>When an interpreter is created, <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> initializes this variable to hold the name of a directory containing the system library of <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> scripts.  The initial value of <B>itcl::library</B> is set from the ITCL_LIBRARY environment variable if it exists, or from a compiled-in value otherwise. 
<DT><B>itcl::patchLevel</B>
<DD>When an interpreter is created, <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> initializes this variable to hold the current patch level for <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B>. For example, the value "<B>2.0p1</B>" indicates <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> version 2.0 with the first set of patches applied. 
<DT><B>itcl::purist</B>
<DD>When an interpreter is created containing Tcl/Tk and the <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> namespace facility, this variable controls a "backward-compatibility" mode for widget access. <P>
In vanilla Tcl/Tk, there is a single pool of commands, so the access command for a widget is the same as the window name. When a widget is created within a namespace, however, its access command is installed in that namespace, and should be accessed outside of the namespace using a qualified name.  For example, <PRE>
namespace foo {
    namespace bar {
        button .b -text "Testing"
    }
}
foo::bar::.b configure -background red
pack .b
</PRE>
Note that the window name ".b" is still used in conjunction with commands like <B>pack</B> and <B>destroy</B>.  However, the access command for the widget (i.e., name that appears as the <I>first</I> argument on a command line) must be more specific. <P>
The "<B>winfo command</B>" command can be used to query the fully-qualified access command for any widget, so one can write: <PRE>
[winfo command .b] configure -background red
</PRE>
and this is good practice when writing library procedures.  Also, in conjunction with the <B>bind</B> command, the "%q" field can be used in place of "%W" as the access command: <PRE>
bind Button &lt;Key-Return&gt; {%q flash; %q invoke}
</PRE>
While this behavior makes sense from the standpoint of encapsulation, it causes problems with existing Tcl/Tk applications.  Many existing applications are written with bindings that use "%W".  Many library procedures assume that the window name is the access command. <P>
The <B>itcl::purist</B> variable controls a backward-compatibility mode.  By default, this variable is "0", and the window name can be used as an access command in any context.  Whenever the <B>unknown</B> procedure stumbles across a widget name, it simply uses "<B>winfo command</B>" to determine the appropriate command name.  If this variable is set to "1", this backward-compatibility mode is disabled.  This gives better encapsulation, but using the window name as the access command may lead to "invalid command" errors. 
<DT><B>itcl::version</B>
<DD>When an interpreter is created, <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> initializes this variable to hold the version number of the form <I>x.y</I>. Changes to <I>x</I> represent major changes with probable incompatibilities and changes to <I>y</I> represent small enhancements and bug fixes that retain backward compatibility. <P>
