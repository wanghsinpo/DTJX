 foreach - Iterate over all elements in one or more lists <P>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
 <B>foreach <I>varname list body</B></I> <BR>
<B>foreach <I>varlist1 list1</B></I> ?<I>varlist2 list2 ...</I>? <I>body</I> <HR>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>foreach</B> command implements a loop where the loop variable(s) take on values from one or more lists. In the simplest case there is one loop variable, <I>varname</I>, and one list, <I>list</I>, that is a list of values to assign to <I>varname</I>. The <I>body</I> argument is a Tcl script. For each element of <I>list</I> (in order from first to last), <B>foreach</B> assigns the contents of the element to <I>varname</I> as if the <B>lindex</B> command had been used to extract the element, then calls the Tcl interpreter to execute <I>body</I>. <P>
In the general case there can be more than one value list (e.g., <I>list1</I> and <I>list2</I>), and each value list can be associated with a list of loop variables (e.g., <I>varlist1</I> and <I>varlist2</I>). During each iteration of the loop the variables of each <I>varlist</I> are assigned consecutive values from the corresponding <I>list</I>. Values in each <I>list</I> are used in order from first to last, and each value is used exactly once. The total number of loop iterations is large enough to use up all the values from all the value lists. If a value list does not contain enough elements for each of its loop variables in each iteration, empty values are used for the missing elements. <P>
The <B>break</B> and <B>continue</B> statements may be invoked inside <I>body</I>, with the same effect as in the <B>for</B> command.  <B>Foreach</B> returns an empty string. <P>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>
 <P>
The following loop uses i and j as loop variables to iterate over pairs of elements of a single list. <PRE>
set x {}
foreach {i j} {a b c d e f} {
    lappend x $j $i
}
# The value of x is "b a d c f e"
# There are 3 iterations of the loop.
</PRE>
<P>
The next loop uses i and j to iterate over two lists in parallel. <PRE>
set x {}
foreach i {a b c} j {d e f g} {
    lappend x $i $j
}
# The value of x is "a d b e c f {} g"
# There are 4 iterations of the loop.
</PRE>
<P>
The two forms are combined in the following example. <PRE>
set x {}
foreach i {a b c} {j k} {d e f g} {
    lappend x $i $j $k
}
# The value of x is "a d e b f g c {} {}"
# There are 3 iterations of the loop.
</PRE>
