<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
This command allows an application to send Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) command when running under Microsoft Windows. Dynamic Data Exchange is a mechanism where applications can exchange raw data. Each DDE transaction needs a <I>service name</I> and a <I>topic</I>. Both the <I>service name</I> and <I>topic</I> are application defined; Tcl uses the service name <B>TclEval</B>, while the topic name is the name of the interpreter given by <B>dde servername</B>. Other applications have their own <I>service names</I> and <I>topics</I>. For instance, Microsoft Excel has the service name <B>Excel</B>. <P>
The <B>eval</B> and <B>execute</B> commands accept the option <B>-async</B>:

<H2>DDE COMMANDS</H2>
 <P>
The following commands are a subset of the full Dynamic Data Exchange set of commands. 
<DT><B>dde servername </B>?<I>topic</I>?
<DD><B>dde servername</B> registers the interpreter as a DDE server with the service name <B>TclEval</B> and the topic name specified by <I>topic</I>. If no <I>topic</I> is given, <B>dde servername</B> returns the name of the current topic or the empty string if it is not registered as a service. 
<DT><B>dde execute</B> ?<I>-async</I>? <I>service topic data</I>
<DD><B>dde execute</B> takes the <I>data</I> and sends it to the server indicated by <I>service</I> with the topic indicated by <I>topic</I>. Typically, <I>service</I> is the name of an application, and <I>topic</I> is a file to work on.  The <I>data</I> field is given to the remote application. Typically, the application treats the <I>data</I> field as a script, and the script is run in the application.  The <I>-async</I> option requests asynchronous invocation.  The command returns an error message if the script did not run, unless the <B>-async</B> flag was used, in which case the command returns immediately with no error. 
<DT><B>dde poke <I>service topic item data</B></I>
<DD><B>dde poke</B> passes the <I>data</I> to the server indicated by <I>service</I> using the <I>topic</I> and <I>item</I> specified.  Typically, <I>service</I> is the name of an application.  <I>topic</I> is application specific but can be a command to the server or the name of a file to work on.  The <I>item</I> is also application specific and is often not used, but it must always be non-null.  The <I>data</I> field is given to the remote application. 
<DT><B>dde request</B> ?<I>-binary</I>? <I>service topic item</I>
<DD><B>dde request</B> is typically used to get the value of something; the value of a cell in Microsoft Excel or the text of a selection in Microsoft Word. <I>service</I> is typically the name of an application, <I>topic</I> is typically the name of the file, and <I>item</I> is application-specific. The command returns the value of <I>item</I> as defined in the application.  Normally this is interpreted to be a string with terminating null.  If <I>-binary</I> is specified, the result is returned as a byte array. 
<DT><B>dde services <I>service topic</B></I>
<DD><B>dde services</B> returns a list of service-topic pairs that currently exist on the machine. If <I>service</I> and <I>topic</I> are both null strings ({}), then all service-topic pairs currently available on the system are returned. If <I>service</I> is null and <I>topic</I> is not, then all services with the specified topic are returned. If <I>service</I> is not null and <I>topic</I> is, all topics for a given service are returned. If both are not null, if that service-topic pair currently exists, it is returned; otherwise, null is returned. 
<DT><B>dde eval</B> ?<I>-async</I>? <I>topic cmd </I>?<I>arg arg ...</I>?
<DD><B>dde eval</B> evaluates a command and its arguments using the interpreter specified by <I>topic</I>. The DDE service must be the <B>TclEval</B> service.  The <I>-async</I> option requests asynchronous invocation.  The command returns an error message if the script did not run, unless the <B>-async</B> flag was used, in which case the command returns immediately with no error.  This command can be used to replace send on Windows. <P>
<P>
<H2>DDE AND TCL</H2>
 A Tcl interpreter always has a service name of <B>TclEval</B>.  Each different interpreter of all running Tcl applications must be given a unique name specified by <B>dde servername</B>. Each interp is available as a DDE topic only if the <B>dde servername</B> command was used to set the name of the topic for each interp. So a <B>dde services TclEval {}</B> command will return a list of service-topic pairs, where each of the currently running interps will be a topic. <P>
When Tcl processes a <B>dde execute</B> command, the data for the execute is run as a script in the interp named by the topic of the <B>dde execute</B> command. <P>
When Tcl processes a <B>dde request</B> command, it returns the value of the variable given in the dde command in the context of the interp named by the dde topic. Tcl reserves the variable <B>$TCLEVAL$EXECUTE$RESULT</B> for internal use, and <B>dde request</B> commands for that variable will give unpredictable results. <P>
An external application which wishes to run a script in Tcl should have that script store its result in a variable, run the <B>dde execute</B> command, and the run <B>dde request</B> to get the value of the variable. <P>
When using DDE, be careful to ensure that the event queue is flushed using either <B>update</B> or <B>vwait</B>.  This happens by default when using <B>wish</B> unless a blocking command is called (such as <B>exec</B> without adding the <B>&amp;</B> to place the process in the background). If for any reason the event queue is not flushed, DDE commands may hang until the event queue is flushed.  This can create a deadlock situation. <P>
