<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
<I>Note: the <B>case command is obsolete and is supported only for backward compatibility.  At some point in the future it may be removed entirely.  You should use the switch command instead.</B></I> <P>
The <B>case</B> command matches <I>string</I> against each of the <I>patList</I> arguments in order. Each <I>patList</I> argument is a list of one or more patterns.  If any of these patterns matches <I>string</I> then <B>case</B> evaluates the following <I>body</I> argument by passing it recursively to the Tcl interpreter and returns the result of that evaluation. Each <I>patList</I> argument consists of a single pattern or list of patterns.  Each pattern may contain any of the wild-cards described under <B>string match</B>.  If a <I>patList</I> argument is <B>default</B>, the corresponding body will be evaluated if no <I>patList</I> matches <I>string</I>.  If no <I>patList</I> argument matches <I>string</I> and no default is given, then the <B>case</B> command returns an empty string. <P>
Two syntaxes are provided for the <I>patList</I> and <I>body</I> arguments. The first uses a separate argument for each of the patterns and commands; this form is convenient if substitutions are desired on some of the patterns or commands. The second form places all of the patterns and commands together into a single argument; the argument must have proper list structure, with the elements of the list being the patterns and commands. The second form makes it easy to construct multi-line case commands, since the braces around the whole list make it unnecessary to include a backslash at the end of each line. Since the <I>patList</I> arguments are in braces in the second form, no command or variable substitutions are performed on them;  this makes the behavior of the second form different than the first form in some cases. <P>
