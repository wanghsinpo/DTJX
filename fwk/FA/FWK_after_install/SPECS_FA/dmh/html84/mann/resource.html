<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>resource</B> command provides some generic operations for dealing with Macintosh resources.  This command is only supported on the Macintosh platform.  Each Macintosh file consists of two <I>forks</I>: a <I>data</I> fork and a <I>resource</I> fork.  You use the normal open, puts, close, etc. commands to manipulate the data fork. You must use this command, however, to interact with the resource fork.  <I>Option</I> indicates what resource command to perform.  Any unique abbreviation for <I>option</I> is acceptable.  The valid options are: 
<DT><B>resource close <I>rsrcRef</B></I>
<DD>Closes the given resource reference (obtained from <B>resource open</B>).  Resources from that resource file will no longer be available. 
<DT><B>resource delete</B> ?<I>options</I>? <I>resourceType</I>
<DD>This command will delete the resource specified by <I>options</I> and type <I>resourceType</I> (see RESOURCE TYPES below).  The options give you several ways to specify the resource to be deleted. <DL>

<DT><B>-id</B> <I>resourceId</I>
<DD>If the <B>-id</B> option is given the id <I>resourceId</I> (see RESOURCE IDS below) is used to specify the resource to be deleted.  The id must  be a number - to specify a name use the <B>-name</B> option. 
<DT><B>-name</B> <I>resourceName</I>
<DD>If <B>-name</B> is specified, the resource named <I>resourceName</I> will be deleted.  If the <B>-id</B> is also provided, then there must be a resource with BOTH this name and this id.  If no name is provided, then the id will be used regardless of the name of the actual resource. 
<DT><B>-file</B> <I>resourceRef</I>
<DD>If the <B>-file</B> option is specified then the resource will be deleted from the file pointed to by <I>resourceRef</I>.  Otherwise the first resource with the given <I>resourceName</I> and or <I>resourceId</I> which is found on the resource file path will be  deleted.  To inspect the file path, use the <I>resource files</I> command. </DL>

<DT><B>resource files ?<I>resourceRef</B></I>?
<DD>If <I>resourceRef</I>is not provided, this command returns a Tcl list of the resource references for all the currently open resource files. The list is in the normal Macintosh search order for resources.  If  <I>resourceRef</I> is specified, the command will return the path to the file whose resource fork is represented by that token. 
<DT><B>resource list <I>resourceType</B></I> ?<I>resourceRef</I>?
<DD>List all of the resources ids of type <I>resourceType</I> (see RESOURCE TYPES below).  If <I>resourceRef</I> is specified then the command will limit the search to that particular resource file.  Otherwise, all resource files currently opened by the application will be searched. A Tcl list of either the resource name's or resource id's of the found resources will be returned.  See the RESOURCE IDS section below for more details about what a resource id is. 
<DT><B>resource open <I>fileName</B></I> ?<I>access</I>?
<DD>Open the resource for the file <I>fileName</I>.  Standard file access permissions may also be specified (see the manual entry for <B>open</B> for details).  A resource reference (<I>resourceRef</I>) is returned that can be used by the other resource commands.  An error can occur if the file doesn't exist or the file does not have a resource fork. However, if you open the file with write permissions the file and/or resource fork will be created instead of generating an error. 
<DT><B>resource read <I>resourceType</B></I> <I>resourceId</I> ?<I>resourceRef</I>?
<DD>Read the entire resource of type <I>resourceType</I> (see RESOURCE TYPES below) and the name or id of <I>resourceId</I> (see RESOURCE IDS below) into memory and return the result.  If <I>resourceRef</I> is specified we limit our search to that resource file, otherwise we search all open resource forks in the application.  It is important to note that most Macintosh resource use a binary format and the data returned from this command may have embedded NULLs or other non-ASCII data. 
<DT><B>resource types ?<I>resourceRef</B></I>?
<DD>This command returns a Tcl list of all resource types (see RESOURCE TYPES below) found in the resource file pointed to by <I>resourceRef</I>.  If <I>resourceRef</I> is not specified it will return all the resource types found in every resource file currently opened by the application. 
<DT><B>resource write</B> ?<I>options</I>? <I>resourceType</I> <I>data</I>
<DD>This command will write the passed in <I>data</I> as a new resource of type <I>resourceType</I> (see RESOURCE TYPES below).  Several options are available that describe where and how the resource is stored. <DL>

<DT><B>-id</B> <I>resourceId</I>
<DD>If the <B>-id</B> option is given the id <I>resourceId</I> (see RESOURCE IDS below) is used for the new resource, otherwise a unique id will be generated that will not conflict with any existing resource.  However, the id must be a number - to specify a name use the <B>-name</B> option. 
<DT><B>-name</B> <I>resourceName</I>
<DD>If <B>-name</B> is specified the resource will be named <I>resourceName</I>, otherwise it will have the empty string as the name. 
<DT><B>-file</B> <I>resourceRef</I>
<DD>If the <B>-file</B> option is specified then the resource will be written in the file pointed to by <I>resourceRef</I>, otherwise the most recently open resource will be used. 
<DT><B>-force</B>
<DD>If the target resource already exists, then by default Tcl will not overwrite it, but raise an error instead.  Use the -force flag to force overwriting the extant resource. </DL>

<H2>RESOURCE TYPES</H2>
 Resource types are defined as a four character string that is then mapped to an underlying id.  For example, <B>TEXT</B> refers to the Macintosh resource type for text.  The type <B>STR#</B> is a list of counted strings.  All Macintosh resources must be of some type.  See Macintosh documentation for a more complete list of resource types that are commonly used. <P>
<P>
<H2>RESOURCE IDS</H2>
 For this command the notion of a resource id actually refers to two ideas in Macintosh resources.  Every place you can use a resource Id you can use either the resource name or a resource number.  Names are always searched or returned in preference to numbers.  For example, the <B>resource list</B> command will return names if they exist or numbers if the name is NULL. <P>
