 proc - Create a Tcl procedure <P>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
 <B>proc <I>name args body</B></I> <HR>
<P>
<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>proc</B> command creates a new Tcl procedure named <I>name</I>, replacing any existing command or procedure there may have been by that name. Whenever the new command is invoked, the contents of <I>body</I> will be executed by the Tcl interpreter. Normally, <I>name</I> is unqualified (does not include the names of any containing namespaces), and the new procedure is created in the current namespace. If <I>name</I> includes any namespace qualifiers, the procedure is created in the specified namespace. <I>Args</I> specifies the formal arguments to the procedure.  It consists of a list, possibly empty, each of whose elements specifies one argument.  Each argument specifier is also a list with either one or two fields.  If there is only a single field in the specifier then it is the name of the argument; if there are two fields, then the first is the argument name and the second is its default value. <P>
When <I>name</I> is invoked a local variable will be created for each of the formal arguments to the procedure; its value will be the value of corresponding argument in the invoking command or the argument's default value. Arguments with default values need not be specified in a procedure invocation.  However, there must be enough actual arguments for all the formal arguments that don't have defaults, and there must not be any extra actual arguments.  There is one special case to permit procedures with variable numbers of arguments.  If the last formal argument has the name <B>args</B>, then a call to the procedure may contain more actual arguments than the procedure has formals.  In this case, all of the actual arguments starting at the one that would be assigned to <B>args</B> are combined into a list (as if the <B>list</B> command had been used); this combined value is assigned to the local variable <B>args</B>. <P>
When <I>body</I> is being executed, variable names normally refer to local variables, which are created automatically when referenced and deleted when the procedure returns.  One local variable is automatically created for each of the procedure's arguments. Global variables can only be accessed by invoking the <B>global</B> command or the <B>upvar</B> command. Namespace variables can only be accessed by invoking the <B>variable</B> command or the <B>upvar</B> command. <P>
The <B>proc</B> command returns an empty string.  When a procedure is invoked, the procedure's return value is the value specified in a <B>return</B> command.  If the procedure doesn't execute an explicit <B>return</B>, then its return value is the value of the last command executed in the procedure's body. If an error occurs while executing the procedure body, then the procedure-as-a-whole will return that same error. <P>
