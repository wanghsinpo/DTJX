<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
These procedures were used in Tk 3.6 and earlier releases to help manage pulldown menus and to implement keyboard traversal of menus. In Tk 4.0 and later releases they are no longer needed.  Stubs for these procedures have been retained for backward compatibility, but they have no effect.  You should remove calls to these procedures from your code, since eventually the procedures will go away. <P>
