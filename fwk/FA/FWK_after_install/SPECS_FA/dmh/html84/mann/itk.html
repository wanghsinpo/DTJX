 itk - framework for building mega-widgets in Tcl/Tk <HR>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
Mega-widgets are high-level widgets that are constructed using Tk widgets as component parts, usually without any C code.  A fileselectionbox, for example, may have a few listboxes, some entry widgets and some control buttons.  These individual widgets are put together in a way that makes them act like one big widget.  A fileselectionbox mega-widget can be created with a command like: <PRE>
fileselectionbox .fsb -background blue -foreground white
</PRE>
Once it has been created, it can be reconfigured with a command like: <PRE>
.fsb configure -background green -foreground black
</PRE>
and all of its internal components will change color.  Each mega-widget has a set of methods that can be used to manipulate it.  For example, the current selection can be queried from a fileselectionbox like this: <PRE>
set fileName [.fsb get]
</PRE>
In effect, a mega-widget looks and acts exactly like a Tk widget, but is considerably easier to implement. <P>
<B>[incr&nbsp;Tk]</B> is a framework for building mega-widgets.  It uses <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> to support the object paradigm, and adds base classes which provide default widget behaviors. <P>
All <B>[incr&nbsp;Tk]</B> widgets are derived from the <B>Archetype</B> base class.  This class manages internal component widgets, and provides methods like "configure" and "cget" to access configuration options. <P>
The <B>Widget</B> base class inherits everything from <B>Archetype</B>, and adds a Tk frame which acts as a container for the mega-widget. It is used to build mega-widgets that sit inside of other frames and toplevels.  Derived classes create other internal components and pack them into the "hull" frame created by the <B>Widget</B> base class. <P>
The <B>Toplevel</B> base class inherits everything from <B>Archetype</B>, but adds a Tk toplevel which acts as a container for the mega-widget. It is used to build mega-widgets, such as dialog boxes, that have their own toplevel window.  Derived classes create other internal components and pack them into the "hull" toplevel created by the <B>Toplevel</B> base class. <P>

<H2>[incr Widgets] LIBRARY</H2>
 <P>
<B>[incr&nbsp;Widgets]</B> is a mega-widget library built using <B>[incr&nbsp;Tk]</B>.  It can be used right out of the box, and contains more than 30 different widget classes, including: 
<DT>-
<DD>fileselectiondialog 
<DT>-
<DD>tabnotebook 
<DT>-
<DD>panedwindow 
<DT>-
<DD>combobox 
<DT>-
<DD>optionmenu 
<DT>-
<DD>scrolledlistbox 
<DT>-
<DD>scrolledframe 
<DT>-
<DD>messagedialog 
<DT>-
<DD>and many others... <P>
The <B>catalog</B> demo in the "iwidgets/demos" directory shows all of the available widgets in action.  Each widget class has its own man page describing the features available. <P>
