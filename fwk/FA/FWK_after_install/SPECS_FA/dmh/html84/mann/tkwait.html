<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
 <P>
The <B>tkwait</B> command waits for one of several things to happen, then it returns without taking any other actions. The return value is always an empty string. If the first argument is <B>variable</B> (or any abbreviation of it) then the second argument is the name of a global variable and the command waits for that variable to be modified. If the first argument is <B>visibility</B> (or any abbreviation of it) then the second argument is the name of a window and the <B>tkwait</B> command waits for a change in its visibility state (as indicated by the arrival of a VisibilityNotify event).  This form is typically used to wait for a newly-created window to appear on the screen before taking some action. If the first argument is <B>window</B> (or any abbreviation of it) then the second argument is the name of a window and the <B>tkwait</B> command waits for that window to be destroyed. This form is typically used to wait for a user to finish interacting with a dialog box before using the result of that interaction. <P>
While the <B>tkwait</B> command is waiting it processes events in the normal fashion, so the application will continue to respond to user interactions. If an event handler invokes <B>tkwait</B> again, the nested call to <B>tkwait</B> must complete before the outer call can complete. <P>
