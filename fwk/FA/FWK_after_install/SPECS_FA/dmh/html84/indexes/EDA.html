The Interface A Component for SEMI Equipment Data Acquisition</h2></center>

<h3>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b></h3>
Hume Integration has developed a series of high-level application components
which build upon the high performance and portable architectural framework
provided by the Hume Datahub and the DMH message system. The Interface
A Component provides the software features needed to implement the SEMI
standard Interface A for Equipment Data Acquisition (EDA). This standard
is described in SEMI document PR8/3563. Interface A is designed to support
the concurrent flow of equipment data to multiple host applications. In
contrast, current standards for SECS-II are designed for data exchange
between a single equipment and a single host.
<p>The component software consists of prototype applications to demonstrate
both the equipment and equipment client roles described in the standard,
along with Tcl language source code. The source code is customized and
extended in order to deploy a production application for particular equipment.
The EDA component software can be integrated with a SECS/GEM interface
that has been developed using any vendor's toolset or with a SECS/GEM interface
developed using the Hume Datahub SDK.
<h3>
<a NAME="Installation"></a><b>Installation</b></h3>
For convenience, two prototype EDA applications are delivered as standalone
single file applications using <a href="http://www.equi4.com/starkit.html">Starkit</a>
technology:
<ul>
<li>
<b>edaequip</b> (edaequip.exe on Windows platforms) - An application which
implements the Equipment or server role of Interface A.</li>

<li>
<b>edaclient</b> (edaclient.exe on Windows platforms) - An application
which implements the Host role of Interface A - the receiver of equipment
data.</li>
</ul>
To install these programs, simply copy the executable files to a directory
of your choice such as folder on the Windows Desktop. On both applications
there is a Save menu action under the File menu. This action causes multiple
files of SQL statements to be written to the program's working directory
in order to save the current configuration of the application. So the Save
action cannot be used if the programs are running from a read-only directory
such as on a DVD drive.
<p>The terminology of client and server can be somewhat confusing with
Interface A since both sides of the interface implement the HTTP server
protocol to receive data from the other side, and both sides use the HTTP
client protocol to initiate messages. The Equipment role is deemed the
server since this side of Interface A serves process data and events to
multiple clients.
<p>For development, the EDA software extends the software base provided
by the Hume Datahub SDK with new capabilities for using XML, SOAP, HTTP,
and SEMI standard EDA messages. The component software also uses other
packages found in the Hume Datahub SDK that are optionally installed. If
you use the Hume Package Installation tool to install the EDA component,
you are guided in selecting the needed prerequisites. The following software
packages are needed:
<ul>
<li>
The Hume Datahub SDK core software.</li>

<li>
The Incr Tcl, Incr Tk, and Iwidgets packages option which extends the core
software to include Object-Oriented programming commands.</li>

<li>
The Humelib package which is a library shared by the Hume Components.</li>

<li>
The Tcl xml version 2.6 package. This package is a patched and re-arranged
version of the freely available xml and expat packages from Zveno Pty Ltd.
Hume Integration has fixed memory leaks and made the package compatible
with Starkits.</li>

<li>
Last but not least, the EDA component is installed to create the additional
package library directory <b>eda1.0</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="applications"></a><b>Demonstration Applications</b></h3>
The standalone applications, <b>edaequip</b> and <b>edaclient</b>, can
be used to demonstrate, exercise, and/or test various aspects of the Interface
A standard for Equipment Data Acquisition. The <b>edaequip</b> application
can be configured to concurrently operate with any number of clients. Menu
functions are provided to initiate sending all of the basic EDA message
types to the clients. The <b>edaequip</b> application is able to receive
and process all standard EDA messages initiated by the client including
those for Data Collection Plan management. The data exchanged and diagnostic
status information can be displayed and optionally saved to files. The
server's configuration including the names of Data Collection Plans can
be saved and re-used in future sessions.
<p>The <b>edaclient</b> application is designed to initiate messages to
a single equipment instance at a time. You are expected to run multiple
instances of the application, typically on multiple computer systems, to
exercise the equipment's ability to support multiple simultaneous clients.
Because the <b>edaclient</b> receives messages through an HTTP interface,
it can actually receive EDA messages from any number of equipment servers
simultaneously. So it is possible to use a single instance of the <b>edaclient</b>
application, and in sequence activate Data Collection Plans with multiple
equipment instances, and then collect the resultant data messages at the
single <b>edaclient</b> instance.
<p>As described in the standard, SEMI envisions that equipment supporting
Interface A will also support a SECS interface. The two kinds of equipment
interfaces are not necessarily interdependent - there is no need to deploy
a SECS interface in order to have a fully functional Interface A. We think
that there are situations where deploying only Interface A without a SECS
interface makes sense, and the vision of Interface A only existing as a
complement to the SECS interface will be revised. Opinions aside, the demonstration
programs feature Interface A capability without SECS interfaces. The programs
are intended to inspire confidence in the evaluator that Interface A technology
is tangible, and that well designed, working software tools to deploy the
new standard are available from Hume Integration Software. For the equipment
provider, the Hume developed Interface A server software can be integrated
into a controller system which may feature a SECS interface based on any
software tools, not just the SECS/GEM software available from Hume. For
the equipment integrator, the Hume developed Interface A client software
provides all of the needed integration elements including HTTP protocol
support, a full-fledged XML parser, and connectivity solutions for a wide
variety of programming environments across various operating system platforms.
<h3>
<a NAME="edaequip"></a><b>The Edaequip Application</b></h3>
You can start running the equipment server application without any prior
configuration or command line arguments.&nbsp; If you have used the Save
menu action in a prior session, the program starts with the configuration
that was previously saved.&nbsp; When you first start the program, two
windows are created.&nbsp; The larger window that appears on top is a user
interface for the EDA Equipment Server functionality.&nbsp; It has fields
to configure the Interface A properties and also features displays of exchanged
EDA messages and status information.&nbsp; The smaller window which starts
iconified is a user interface for the <a href="http://www.hume.com/lnkdatahub.html">Hume
Datahub</a> features.&nbsp; It is not necessary to interact with this smaller
window except when shutting down the program.&nbsp; Closing the large EDA
window does not stop the execution of the EDA interface or exit the program.&nbsp;
This behavior demonstrates that the EDA software can be used with or without
the Hume written user interface.&nbsp; The program exits when the smaller
Datahub window is closed.
<p>The edaequip program embeds a functional HTTP (web) server.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you configure an actual directory name for the <b>httpd root directory</b>,
that directory and its contents are served by the web server and can be
browsed by standard web browsers from anywhere on your network.&nbsp; Its
ok to configure a non-existent directory for the httpd root directory to
avoid serving real files; the EDA interface will still function.&nbsp;
In most cases you will not configure the <b>httpd interface</b> value -
the entryfield is usually left blank.&nbsp; If you have multiple network
cards, you can choose which network interface to serve by specifying its
hostname or IP address as the <b>httpd interface</b> value.&nbsp; You can
also configure the httpd interface to the special value <b>localhost</b>.&nbsp;
The <b>localhost</b> hostname makes the EDA server interface visible only
to software running on your own computer system, and your system will not
be reachable from the network.
<p>An important web server parameter is the <b>httpd port</b> integer value.&nbsp;
The value <b>80</b> is the default for the HTTP protocol. A particular
port can be used by only one server at a time. In other words, unique port
values need to be assigned to every TCP/IP socket server on a computer
system. There is no problem having multiple instances of servers running
as long as they serve unique ports. Application software is usually assigned
port values greater than 1024 to avoid conflicts with system software.
You will not be able to use the value <b>80</b> if you do not have system
level privileges on the computer system.&nbsp; In that case, it is recommended
that a value greater than 5000 be used after examining the /etc/services
file or reviewing the output of the operating system <b>netstat</b> command
for possible conflicts.
<p>The web server feature in not enabled until you press the <b>Enable
</b>button.&nbsp;
This gives you a chance to configure a suitable directory and port before
going online.&nbsp; An Interface A client connects to your web server by
specifying a URL that appears to be a document reference.&nbsp; You are
able to specify an arbitrary document name for the <b>Url Document</b>
configuration value; the default value is EDA.xml.&nbsp; When you press
the <b>Enable</b> button, the status field labeled <b>Served Url</b> located
just below the button shows the actual served URL that the client can use
to connect to your EDA server instance.&nbsp; You may change the httpd
root directory, the httpd port, or the Url Document at any time by editing
the field values and then pressing the <b>Enable</b> button again to have
your new values take effect.&nbsp; The change is nearly instantaneous.
<p>Interface A has the notions of <b>To</b> and <b>From</b> address designations
in the EDA message headers.&nbsp; For both the <b>edaequip</b> and the
<b>edaclient</b>
program, you are able to configure unique values used as your own From
address when initiating messages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you have a reason
otherwise, we suggest you configure these fields to be the URL value that
is used to connect to your program instance.&nbsp; In fact, if you delete
the current value so that the field is blank, the value gets set to your
URL value when your HTTP server interface is enabled.
<p>The edaequip user interface also provides entry fields to configure
the data items making up the <b>Equipment ID</b> structure, namely <b>Supplier</b>,
<b>Model</b>
and <b>ImmutableID</b>.&nbsp; From the standpoint of the current software,
these are just arbitrary strings that are passed in messages.
<p>The <b>edaequip</b> application implements the simple retry behavior
specified in the standard when it is not able to successfully transfer
a message to a client.&nbsp; HTTP is a synchronous protocol; there is a
reply expected in response to every message sent.&nbsp; The <b>Reply Timeout</b>
is the interval of time allowed for a client response to be received successfully.&nbsp;
If a response is not received, the logic will attempt a resend after delaying
for the configurable <b>Retry Interval</b> value.&nbsp; There is also a
<b>Retry
Max Attempts</b> integer value that is configured to set the number of
attempts to be used when failure is encountered.&nbsp; You are able to
specify different values of these timeout and retry parameters for each
client, or you may specify that the shared default values are used for
a client by setting that client's values to the special value 0. The configured
values in the framed window labeled <b>Default Sending Configuration</b>
are the values used as default values for all clients that do not have
their own non-zero configured values.
<p>EDA Event Data messages have a Locator data element which is intended
to help identify the context of the data.&nbsp; You are able to configure
the Locator data element using the entryfield labeled <b>Event Location</b>.
<p>For demonstration purposes, the <b>edaequip</b> application relies on
manual configuration of a set of <b>Data Collection Plans</b>.&nbsp; The
program logic creates example plan names if you have not configured and
saved your own set.&nbsp; A real Interface A application is integrated
with the equipment controller(s) and the list of defined Data Collection
Plans is determined programmatically.&nbsp; The standard EDA messages do
not show the client descriptions of the defined plans - the client only
sees the plan names.&nbsp; Also, the standard message definitions cannot
properly handle plan names that imbed white space.
<p>The main part of the <b>edaequip</b> user interface is a tabbed notebook
window.&nbsp; If the mouse selection button is clicked on the tab labeled
<b>Clients</b>
a different window pane is shown where the configuration of clients is
displayed in a table.&nbsp; New client records can be added by pressing
the <b>Add...</b> button.&nbsp; The <b>To Address</b> of each client record
must be unique because this is how the clients are distinguished when client
messages are received.&nbsp; An implication of this behavior is that you
must configure each client application instance to have a unique header
From Address in order to have them all successfully communicate with your
<b>edaequip</b>
instance.&nbsp; You can optionally specify a proxy host and proxy port
if these are needed to reach the client HTTP server for messages initiated
by the <b>edaequip</b>.&nbsp; The editing dialog allows you to choose either
the <b>ok</b> or <b>disabled</b> state value for a client.&nbsp; If the
state value is set to <b>ok</b>, it means that messages can be sent to
the client.&nbsp; If the state value is set to <b>disabled</b> it means
that the logic should not attempt to send any messages to the client.&nbsp;
You cannot configure the state values of
<b>busy</b> or <b>down</b>.&nbsp;
These values are set by the running software to manage sending to the client.&nbsp;
The state of <b>down</b> is assigned after the retry and timeout periods
have been exhausted when attempting to send a message.&nbsp; The logic
does not attempt to send further messages to a client whose state value
is <b>down</b>.&nbsp; The client remains in the <b>down</b> state until
that client has sent a message to the server, or until the user has reconfigured
the client state value.
<p>If you wish to save the current server configuration, use the <b>Save</b>
menu action under the <b>File</b> menu.&nbsp; Your configuration will be
saved as files of SQL statements in the current working directory.&nbsp;
A saved configuration is loaded&nbsp; automatically at the next program
start.
<p>The edaequip has other features to vary the displayed trace data of
messages sent and received, or to save the displayed data to the file system.&nbsp;
There are also menu items to send example messages to clients.&nbsp; You
are encouraged to explore these features.&nbsp; The EdaEnabled, EdaDisabled,
and EdaError messages are broadcast messages - they are sent to every client
that is not down or disabled.&nbsp; The other message types are sent to
a single selected client.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="edaclient"></a><b>Host/Client Application</b></h3>
The execution and runtime configuration of the <b>edaclient</b> application
is quite similar to that of the <b>edaequip</b> application.&nbsp; You
do not need to perform any configuration or know any command line arguments
before starting the program.&nbsp; With the client application, there is
only a single EDA user interface window created, and when this window is
closed, the application exits.
<p>The entryfields in the window frame labeled <b>Equipment Target Configuration</b>
are used to specify the <b>Url</b> and other items for your chosen EDA
server.&nbsp; Before you press the <b>Enable</b> button to have your HTTP
server go online, you will need to review the configuration of the <b>httpd
port</b> and make sure it is a unique and acceptable value, and make sure
that you are satisfied with the other web server parameters.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="development"></a><b>Interface A Development</b></h3>
The EDA software is composed of a small number of Incr Tcl classes. You
can develop custom applications by deriving new classes that have selected
methods replaced by your logic, as well as having additional methods. You
can use the Hume DMH message system to control and utilize your classes
from another application process through the exchange of DMH messages.
You do not need to use Tcl/Tk to provide a user interface. You can deploy
a user interface using the software tools of your choice, and use the DMH
message system to interact with the Incr Tcl classes for their non-visual
Interface A functionality.
<p>Here is an overview of the classes, the class names are linked to detailed
information.
<dl>
<dt>
<a href="#eda_class">eda</a></dt>

<br><a NAME="eda_class"></a><font size=+1><b>eda</b> -&nbsp; A base class
for equipment or client EDA</font>
<p><b>Synopsis</b>
<blockquote>none - instantiate edaclient or edaequip instead</blockquote>
<b>Description</b>
<blockquote>This is a base class that has data and methods which are used
for both the EDA server and client roles.</blockquote>
<b>Options (Public Variables)</b>
<ul>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>http_version</b></dt>

<dd>
The class can be told to use either HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 by setting this variable
to the desired version. The EDA standard specifies 1.1 and this is the
default.</dd>

<dt>
<b>httpd_addr</b></dt>

<dd>
You can optionally specify which network interface should be used for the
HTTP server function either as a TCP/IP hostname or as an IP address. Use
this option to specify the desired interface when you have more than one
TCP/IP network address, or you want to restrict the serving to your own
system by specifying localhost. When the field is blank, the default behavior
is operating system dependent but usually makes the server visible on the
first TCP/IP network interface and on the localhost interface. For some
operating systems, the served port is reachable on all network interfaces.</dd>

<dt>
<b>httpd_doc</b></dt>

<dd>
This item is the document name that is served by the HTTP server for the
purpose of being a target for EDA communication. The document does not
have to exist. The default value is EDA.xml</dd>

<dt>
<b>httpd_port</b></dt>

<dd>
This is the TCP/IP port value that is used to receive EDA messages. The
value 80 is the default for the HTTP protocol. A particular port can be
used by only one server at a time. In other words, unique port values need
to be assigned to every TCP/IP socket server on a computer system. There
is no problem having multiple instances of servers running as long as they
serve unique ports. Application software such as the <b>edaclient</b> is
usually assigned port values greater than 1024 to avoid conflicts with
system software.</dd>

<dt>
<b>httpd_root</b></dt>

<dd>
The root of the file system to be served. A non-existent directory can
be named if you do not wish to serve documents. Do not specify a directory
containing private data files, or having private files in any subdirectory.</dd>

<dt>
<b>soap_nsid</b></dt>

<dd>
The SOAP namespace identifier used for outgoing messages.&nbsp; Defaults
to "soap".&nbsp; The value "SOAP-ENV" is also commonly used.</dd>

<dt>
<b>TRACE</b></dt>

<dd>
This field is used as a bitfield to control the output of diagnostic information.
The bit values have the following meanings:</dd>

<dl>

<b>Class Methods</b>
<ul>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>boolean <i>value</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method maps any of the allowed boolean formats in Tcl such as <b>true</b>
or <b>1</b> to the values <b>1</b> or <b>0</b> which are useable for EDA
boolean values. It can also be used in the opposite direction to map any
of the allowed EDA boolean values to <b>1</b> or <b>0</b>.</dd>

<dt>
<b>dateTime {<i>ts16</i> {}}</b></dt>

<dd>
When called with no argument, the method returns a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime">standard
dateTime</a> value for the current time. The method can also convert a
<a href="../mann/localtime.html">localtime 16</a> value to an XML dateTime
value.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtEqIDMessageBody <i>type SupModId</i> {<i>nv_args</i> {}} {<i>sanitize</i>
1}</b></dt>

<dd>
The method returns a formatted XML string for the EDA message structures
that contain an EquipmentID as the first item. The <i>type</i> argument
is the message type such as <b>IsEdaEnabled</b>. The <i>SupModId</i> is
a list of three elements, the Supplier, Model, and ImmuteableID. The <i>nv_args</i>
is an optional argument to pass in a list of alternating tagnames and values
to be appended to the message after the EquipmentID. If the <i>nv_args</i>
contains nested tagnames and values, then the <i>sanitize</i> argument
must be set to 0 to prevent escaping the nested tag angle brackets as if
they were intended to be simply part of the data value.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtEquipmentID <i>SupModID</i></b></dt>

<dd>
The calling argument is a list of three elements, the Supplier, Model,
and ImmutableID. The return value is a formatted XML string for an EquipmentID
data structure.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtFault <i>faultcode faultstring</i> {<i>detail</i> {}}</b></dt>

<dd>
This method returns a formatted XML string for a SOAP Fault data structure.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtMessageHeader <i>To From</i> {<i>CorrelationId</i> {}}</b></dt>

<dd>
This method returns a formatted XML string for the MessageHeader structure.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtSoapEnvelope <i>header body</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method returns a formatted XML string where the EDA message header
and body are wrapped in SOAP Header and SOAP Body tags and then wrapped
together in a SOAP Envelope tag.&nbsp; The identifier used for the SOAP
namespace is the configurable value of <b>soap_nsid</b>.</dd>

<dt>
<b>getFrom</b></dt>

<dd>
This method returns the default <b>From</b> header data element which is
the result of executing <b>getURL</b>.</dd>

<dt>
<b>getURL</b></dt>

<dd>
This method returns the served URL for the HTTP receiving interface.</dd>

<dt>
<b>httpd_doc_set</b></dt>

<dd>
This method is called automatically when you configure the httpd_doc value.
It updates the HTTP server so that the desired document is served.</dd>

<dt>
<b>httpd_enable <i>on</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This call is used to enable or disable the HTTP server interface depending
on if the <i>on</i> argument is <b>1</b> or <b>0</b>.</dd>

<dt>
<b>httpd_respond</b></dt>

<dd>
This method is replaced in derived classes. The method is executed by the
HTTP server logic as a callback when there is a request for the EDA URL.</dd>

<dt>
<b>httpd_trace</b></dt>

<dd>
This method is replaced in derived classes. The method is executed by the
HTTP server logic to pass trace information.</dd>

<dt>
<b>SOAPhttpHeader <i>action</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method supplies the SOAPAction header string that appears as an HTTP
header for the specified message type.</dd>

<dt>
<b>tsdiff <i>ts_start</i> {<i>ts_end</i> {}}</b></dt>

<dd>
Returns a floating point value for the number of seconds between two XML
dateTime values or between the current time and a single dateTime value.
The input format for XML dateTime values is restricted to the format provided
by the <b>dateTime</b> method.</dd>

<dt>
<b>xml_desanitize <i>xml</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method replaces &amp; escape sequences which are used with XML to
pass characters which have special meaning such as <b>&lt;</b> back to
the non-escaped characters. The method is called by the <b>xml_sanitize</b>
method so that you can call the <b>xml_sanitize</b> method more than once
without converting &amp;amp; to &amp;amp;amp; etc.</dd>

<dt>
<b>xml_desoap <i>cache</i> {<i>update_struct</i> 1} {<i>copy_struct</i>
0}</b></dt>

<dd>
The method <b>xml_parse</b> described next is used to parse an XML string
into an array. After parsing, the <b>xml_desoap</b> method can be called
to remove the SOAP tags from the parsed result, to determine the EDA message
type and write it as the array element __msgtype__, and to update the array
element __struct__ which describes the message structure. The revised __struct__
element describes the simplified message structure that remains after the
SOAP tags have been removed. If the optional argument <i>copy_struct</i>
is set true, and the <i>update_struct</i> argument is true, the original
message structure before the SOAP tags removal is copied to the array element
__struct0__. The return value of the <b>xml_desoap</b> method is 1 if the
input <i>xml</i> was standard and had the expected SOAP tags. The return
value is 0 if the SOAP tags were not found. In this description, SOAP tags
refers to the tags, &lt;soap>:Envelope, &lt;soap>:Header, and &lt;soap>:Body
where &lt;soap> is the namespace identifier used for the SOAP namespace.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To understand this method and <b>xml_parse</b> in detail, it is suggested
that you interactively execute them from the command prompt, and examine
the result array <i>cache</i> using the <a href="../mann/info_data.html">info_data</a>
command. The method <b>xtest8</b> is an example of using the parsing calls
which features output to the console.</dd>

<dt>
<b>xml_parse <i>xml</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method is called to parse an XML formatted string into an array. The
name of the array is the return value of the method call. When you are
done using the result array, you must <a href="../mann/unset.html">unset</a>
it to recover the memory used for the array. Elements are added to the
array which show the nesting of XML tags as the tag names concatenated
with periods. For example, parsing the IsEdaEnabled message results in
an array element with a subscript that is similar to <b>soap:Envelope.soap:Body.IsEdaEnabled.EquipmentID.Supplier</b>
along with other similar array elements. The <b>xml_desoap</b> method described
above removes the SOAP tags and simplifies the parse result so that the
example subscript becomes <b>IsEdaEnabled.EquipmentID.Supplier</b>. The
<b>xml_parse</b> method also writes an array element <b>__struct__</b>
which shows the structure of the XML input. For example, the <b>__struct__</b>
array element for an IsEdaEnabled message is similar to <b>{soap:Envelope
{soap:Header {MessageHeader {To} {From}}} {soap:Body {IsEdaEnabled {EquipmentID
{Supplier} {Model} {ImmutableID}}}}}</b>.</dd>

<p><br>XML can have tag sequences that are repeated more than once. For
example, there could be multiple values for the same measured parameter
in an EdaData message. The parsing logic converts repeated values to a
Tcl list of values. You can determine how many instances of a tagged value
are in the input message by looking at the <a href="../mann/llength.html">list
length</a> of the output array value, or by analyzing the <b>__struct__</b>
array element value.
<p>EDA <b>Param</b> elements defined by the standard have the property
that a tag for the type of data element (eg., <b>IntVal</b>, <b>FloatVal</b>,
...) is part of the tag sequence leading to the characters representing
the element's value. The standard proscribes:
<blockquote>...&lt;Value>&lt;FloatVal>43.56&lt;/FloatVal>&lt;/Value>...</blockquote>
This property means that you cannot know the tag sequence leading to a
value without knowing the data type tag being used. Fundamentally with
XML strings all the data is passed as character string data, so this obsession
with data type seems to be an anachronism. Hume Integration to the rescue
- the <b>xml_parse</b> method has logic to rearrange <b>Value</b> tag sequences
so that the array element for the <b>Value</b> tag shows the value and
a new tag <b>ValueType</b> shows the tag used to indicate the data type.
The parse result is as if the standard was:
<blockquote>...&lt;Value>43.56&lt;/Value>&lt;ValueType>FloatVal&lt;/ValueType>...</blockquote>
This means that you can use the array of parse results, and find <b>Param</b>
values at the same subscript irrespective of whether the sender tagged
the value as <b>FloatVal</b>,
<b>DoubleVal</b>, <b>IntVal</b>, or some
other storage type.

The Interface A Equipment class</font>
<p><b>Synopsis</b>
<blockquote><b>package require edaequip</b>
<br><b>edaequip::supervisor</b>
<br><b>edaequip <i>objname</i> [-<i>option_name option_value</i>]*</b>
<br><b><i>objname</i> <i>methodname</i> [<i>method_argument</i>]*</b></blockquote>
<b>Description</b>
<blockquote>This class is used to provide the equipment role of SEMI Interface
A. To integrate this software into a production application, pay particular
attention to the methods whose names start with <b>ii_</b>. This prefix
has the meaning of <b>integration interface</b>. By coding your own version
of these methods, you will make your equipment respond to the commands
that are received through Interface A. In addition, you will need to provide
for sending data and event messages as determined by the activated Data
Collection Plans. The methods whose names begin with <b>eg</b> are examples
of creating different EDA message types that equipment inititates. The
example application <b>edaequip</b> is able to send an example message
of every currently defined EDA type. The method
<b>broadcast</b> is used
to send the same message to every client. Certain EDA message types are
broadcast such as the <b>EdaEnabled</b> message. The method
<b>postmsg</b>
is used to send an EDA message to a single client. As long as a client's
Data Collection Plan is still active, your equipment should continue to
post data messages selected by the plan. If the client becomes unresponsive,
all of his activated plans will be deactivated. This occurs after a series
of retry attempts spanning a series of waiting periods, so it is common
that there may be more than one data message queued for delivery to the
client. Your logic will know to stop posting messages for a plan from any
of the following inputs:
<ol>
<li>
The plan is no longer listed in the eda_client_active_dcp table so it was
deactivated. Your logic could know this by querying the table at the time
of sending, or by subscribing to changes in the table data.</li>

<li>
You have customized the <b>ii_DeactivatePlan</b> method and your logic
was executed when the method was invoked to deactivate the particular plan
for the particular client.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<b>Options (Public Variables)</b>
<ul>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>eq_From</b></dt>

<dd>
This value specifies the string value that is used in the EDA message headers
as the From field for this equipment instance. If the value is left as
an empty string, the logic will use the instance's receiving URL.</dd>

<dt>
<b>ImmutableID</b></dt>

<dd>
This string value should be set to a unique value. It is part of the EquipmentID
data structure.</dd>

<dt>
<b>IsEnabled</b></dt>

<dd>
This variable is used as a boolean to determine whether the Interface A
is enabled by the stock <b>ii_IsEdaEnabled</b> method. Its value is provided
in response to the <b>IsEdaEnabled</b> client request. An integrator can
choose to update this variable's value or to customize the
<b>ii_IsEdaEnabled</b>
method.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Locator_default</b></dt>

<dd>
Certain EdaData messages have a Locator value which is intended to be an
identifier for an equipment component based on its position in the tool
hierarchy. See paragraph 7.7.3.3.1 in the standard PR8/3563. This option
provides a configured value which can be used as a default value.</dd>

<dt>
<b>log_period</b></dt>

<dd>
The log_period is a configurable interval of time specified in milliseconds
for completed messages to be held in the eda_send_log table. There needs
to be a provision for deleting aged messages from this table so that memory
usage remains bounded. The <b>edaequip</b> application does not delete
logged messages, it is designed for the user to delete them by pressing
a button on the GUI. A real application needs to have programmed deletion
of the logged messages, and using this value with the Tcl <a href="../mann/after.html">after</a>
command is suitable.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Model</b></dt>

<dd>
This string value gets passed as part of the EquipmentID data structure.</dd>

<dt>
<b>reply_timeout_default</b></dt>

<dd>
This value represents the time interval in milliseconds that is allowed
for successfully receiving a reply from a client. The value is a default
value that is used unless there is a non-zero configured value for the
particular client.</dd>

<dt>
<b>retry_interval_default</b></dt>

<dd>
This value represents the time interval in milliseconds that the equipment
waits before initiating another send attempt when the previous send has
failed. The value is actually a default value that is used when there is
not a positive value configured for a client.</dd>

<dt>
<b>retry_max_default</b></dt>

<dd>
This value is the maximum number of times the sending logic will retry
to send a message to a client. The value is a default that is used if there
is not a positive value configured for the client.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Supplier</b></dt>

<dd>
This string value gets passed as part of the EquipmentID data structure.</dd>
</dl>
</ul>
<b>Class Methods</b>
<ul>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>broadcast <i>msgtype</i> {<i>nv_args</i> {}}</b></dt>

<dd>
This method is used to send the same message to every client. Standard
broadcast message types include EdaDisabled, EdaEnabled, and EdaError.
The methods <b>EdaDisabled</b>, <b>EdaEnabled</b>, and <b>PerformanceWarning</b>
are examples of using the <b>broadcast</b> method to send these message
types.</dd>

<dt>
<b>EdaDisabled</b></dt>

<dd>
Sends the EdaDisabled message to all clients.</dd>

<dt>
<b>EdaEnabled</b></dt>

<dd>
Sends the EdaEnabled message to all clients.</dd>

<dt>
<b>egEdaErrorBody</b></dt>

<dd>
Creates an example EdaError message body.</dd>

<dt>
<b>egEventReportBody</b></dt>

<dd>
Creates an example Event body.</dd>

<dt>
<b>EgExEventBody</b></dt>

<dd>
Creates an example exception event (ExEvent) body. The Interface A standard
has further muddied the water by adding SOAP faults, HTTP errors, ExEvents,
and EdaErrors to the E5/E30 notions of alarms and events. The standard
indicates alarms are to be sent as ExEvent data structures, and EDA interference
with tool operation is sent as an EdaError. Therefore we offer this guidance.
If an error condition relates to the equipment and is independent of the
Interface A software use the ExEvent data structure. Only use the EdaError
if the error condition directly relates to the Interface A software.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtEdaDataBody <i>Events</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method prepares an XML EdaData string by adding the EdaData tags and
the EquipmentID structure to zero or more Event or ExEvent sequences concatenated
as a single string argument.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtEdaErrorBody <i>ErrorCode</i> {<i>ErrorType</i> {}} {<i>ErrorDesc</i>
{}} {<i>ErrorTime</i> {}}</b></dt>

<dd>
Formats error information into the XML EdaError string. If the optional
arguments are defaulted, the logic attempts to look up the error description
in the common array <b>ErrorCodes</b></dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtEventBody <i>EventID Locator Data</i> {<i>EventTime</i> {}} {<i>Context</i>
{}} {<i>Extension</i> {}}</b></dt>

<dd>
Formats event data into an XML Event string.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtEventReportBody <i>EventID name_vals</i></b></dt>

<dd>
A simpler call to create an XML Event string with some Data Param values.
The <i>name_vals</i> argument is a list of alternating name and values
which are formatted as floating point Data Param elements.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtExEvent <i>ErrorCode Locator ExType ExDesc</i> {<i>ExState</i> none}
{<i>ExTime</i> {}} {<i>Severity</i> {}} {<i>Data</i> {}} {<i>Extension</i>
{}}</b></dt>

<dd>
Formats exception event data into an XML ExEvent string.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtParam <i>Name Value</i> {<i>type</i> FloatVal} {<i>Locator</i> {}}
{<i>MeasTime</i> {}} {<i>Extension</i> {}}</b></dt>

<dd>
Formats parameter data into an XML Param string.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtResponseBody <i>type</i> {<i>nv_args</i> {}} {<i>Error</i> {}}</b></dt>

<dd>
Generic logic to format the XML reply for any of the client data management
commands. The <i>type</i> argument is the response message type such as
<b>IsEdaEnabledResponse</b>. The caller passes in the name and value items
for response body as an alternating list,
<b>nv_args</b>. The caller can
optionally pass in Error data as a 1, 2, or 4 element list. See the logic
of <b>fmtResponseError</b>.</dd>

<dt>
<b>fmtResponseError <i>Error</i> {<i>skip_tag</i> 0}</b></dt>

<dd>
Formats error item data to create the XML Error structure. The caller can
pass in varying amounts of data and have the logic supply the remaining
items. If the <i>Error</i> list length is 1, it is assumed to be an ErrorCode
and the description is looked up in the ErrorCodes array. If the length
is 2, the first item is the ErrorCode as before, and the second argument
is taken as a value to be substituted in the looked-up error description.
If the list length of <i>Error</i> is 4, the logic assumes the caller is
passing the fields <b>ErrorTime ErrorType ErrorCode</b> and <b>ErrorDesc</b>
in that order. The logic ordinarily adds the surrounding XML Error tag,
but this is suppressed by setting the <i>skip_tag</i> argument to 1.</dd>

<dt>
<b>getFrom</b></dt>

<dd>
This method replaces the base class version with provision for the user
setting eq_From. The result string is used as the From and To header address
for the equipment instance.</dd>

<dt>
<b>httpd_respond <i>url httpd_cache</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method is called by the <b>ehttpd</b> software when an HTTP request
has been received for the equipment's URL. Inbound EDA commands are received
by this method. The logic oversees parsing the message and calling a message
specific method of the name rsp_<i>msgtype</i> to pass the message data
into the application</dd>

<dt>
<b>httpd_trace</b></dt>

<dd>
This method is called by the <b>ehttpd</b> software to pass trace information.</dd>

<dt>
<b>ii_ActivatePlan <i>From dcp_id persistent</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method is called to activate a Data Collection plan for a particular
client. The response logic has already validated that the plan is defined
and that the client is configured and valid. The stock version manages
the state of plans in the SQL table <a href="#eda_client_active_dcp">eda_client_active_dcp</a>.
The method should return 1 if the plan was successfully activated or 0
if not.</dd>

<dt>
<b>ii_DeactivatePlans <i>From plans</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method is called to deactivate a list of one of more plans for a client.
If the client indicated the keyword <b>ALL</b> the response logic has already
converted this to the list of active plans by calling <b>ii_GetActivePlanIds</b>.
The method should deactivate the indicated plans and set the return value
to the list of deactivated plans.</dd>

<dt>
<b>ii_GetActivePlanIds <i>From</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method returns a list of the active plans for the client identified
by the
<i>From</i> header value.</dd>

<dt>
<b>ii_GetDefinedPlanIds</b></dt>

<dd>
This method returns a list of all of the defined Data Collection Plans.</dd>

<dt>
<b>ii_IsDefinedPlan <i>dcp_id</i></b></dt>

<dd>

The method returns 1 if the plan is defined, else 0.</dd>

<dt>
<b>ii_IsEdaClientRecognized <i>From</i></b></dt>

<dd>
This method returns 1 if the client identified by the <i>From</i> header
value is properly configured and allowed to manage plans. A newly discovered
client is not allowed to manage plans until his record in the SQL table
<a href="#eda_client">eda_client</a>
is updated and his <b>send_state</b> value is set to <b>ok</b>.</dd>

<dt>
<b>ii_IsEdaEnabled</b></dt>

<dd>
This method is called to determine the answer to the client request IsEdaEnabled.
The method should return 1 to indicate that the EDA interface is enabled,
else 0.</dd>

<dt>
<b>PerformanceWarning</b></dt>

<dd>
Creates an example EdaError message for the situation of the EDA activity
adversely affecting equipment performance.</dd>

creates a single client instance with an interactive GUI (Graphical User
