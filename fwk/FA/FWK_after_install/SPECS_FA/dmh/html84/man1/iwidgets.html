<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
Iwidgets is a freely available package containing high quality
composite graphical user interface widgets built with the
[incr&nbsp;Tk] and [incr&nbsp;Tcl] extensions.
The installation of Iwidgets usually includes the installation
of demonstration scripts in the subdirectory <b>demos</b> of the Iwidgets
library directory.  These scripts are very useful to see capabilities
of the package, and example code.
The script named <b>catalog</b> is the usual one to execute
from the command line, or to source from a wish shell prompt.
The SYNOPSIS shows the Tcl code needed to load the catalog script
into a dmh_wish shell using statements that are not sensitive
to the version or the installation path of Iwidgets.
For your convenience, on Windows platforms a Start menu program 
item is installed for the catalog script.  
On POSIX platforms, the script <b>iwidgets84</B> is installed 
in the DMH_BIN directory for starting the catalog script.
