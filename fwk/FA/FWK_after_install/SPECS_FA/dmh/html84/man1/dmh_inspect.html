<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
The <b>inspect</b> application is a new development tool authored by 
Hume Integration Software.&nbsp; 
<b>Inspect</b> is used routinely when developing 
Tcl/Tk applications.&nbsp; The program has the ability to interactively display
and modify a running application  
without needing code instrumentation or application changes.&nbsp; 
The program features command entry with history, and is extremely useful for interactively testing newly written code.
<p>
The new <b>inspect</b> application is an updated replacement 
of a similar application that was originally developed by Sam Shen.&nbsp; 
<b>Inspect</b> accommodates new features of Tcl/Tk such as 
namespaces, child interpreters, channels, packages, and command aliases.&nbsp; 
Also, <b>inspect</b> features full support for working with [incr Tcl] 
classes and objects.&nbsp; 
The application is deployed as a standalone executable 
(a <a href="http://www.equi4.com/starkit.html">Starkit</a>) so that you
do not need to have the dependent packages installed, and you can modify
your installed software without affecting its operation.&nbsp;
<P>
When starting <b>inspect</b> you can optionally specify a target
Tcl/Tk application for inspection on the command line.
The logic used to interpret the target specification allows for the
specification of the target interpreter's <b>send</b> command name, or
equivalent connection information when using the Tcl DDE package or
Hume Integration's DMH message system.
<P>
If the specified target contains the <b>@</b> symbol,
and matches the patterns used to specify a DMH message system mailbox such as
<i>mailbox</i><b>@</b><i>DMH_Group</i> or <i>mailbox</i><b>@</b><i>hostname_or_IP</i><b>:</b><i>DMH_Group</i>,
then the program attempts to used the DMH message system to connect to the target.
Otherwise, if the specified target contains the <b>:</b> character, and matches
the pattern <i>hostname_or_IP</i><b>:</b><i>DMH_Group</i> the program connects to the target
as a DMH server application.  If the optionally specified target does not match these
conditions, the program determines if the target matches an interpreter name
being used with the Tcl/Tk <b>send</b> command.  If a match is not found, and the
program is being used on Windows, the program will connect to the specified
target using DDE if the name can be resolved as a DDE servername in use
by a Tcl application.
<p>
See the online help for the <b>inspect</b> application for detailed
information on making your applications inspectable.&nbsp;
If you are using an extended Tcl/Tk shell provided by Hume Integration Software, 
such as <b>dmh_wish</b>, then the <b>send</b> command is implemented on both 
Windows and POSIX platforms.&nbsp; Your applications are enabled for inspection 
without adding any modifications.&nbsp; You can prevent inspection by renaming 
the send command to an empty string.&nbsp;
<P>
A local application is inspectable if it
responds to the <a href="../mann/send.html">send</a> command 
or if it responds to DDE protocol commands on windows.&nbsp;
Inspect is also able to target local or remote Tcl applications that load the 
<b>comm</b> package which is part of the 
<a href="http://tcllib.sourceforge.net">Standard Tcl Library</a>.
An application that uses the DMH message system is also inspectable
if it receives and processes DMH messages either as Tcl or SQL
commands, or if it is acting as the DMH message system server.&nbsp;
When inspecting DMH message system applications, if the mailbox name used by
the target application ends in "_RPC"
<B>inspect</B> assumes that the target application evaluates Tcl commands
as done by the <a href="../mann/mbx_RPC.html">mbx_RPC</A> command.&nbsp;
For other DMH mailbox names, <b>inspect</b> assumes
that the target application processes SQL command messages
in the same fashion as the Hume Datahub.
