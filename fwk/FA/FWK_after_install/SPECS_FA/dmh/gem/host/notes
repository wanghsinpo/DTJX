discover DVVALs in S6F3 post event Discrete Variable Data Send
Maybe you can query sets of DVVALs using S6F7 if made possible
  by vendor defining <DATAID> canned reports.
need vendor documentation

What events are reported by the machine?
What kind of type code is being used?
use S2F37 to enable them all
discover them in S6F11 S6F13
use vendor documentation
use vendor documentation to determine meaning of events, and
  map them to vfei event names.
there is no communicable description or string name
  

what do the state binary codes mean?
use vendor documentation


What type code is being used for reports?
  RPTID
use vendor documentation

What type code is being used for DATAID's?
  DATAID
use vendor documentation


What reports are set up on the machine?
Are they the right ones?
There is no way to ask directly except to initiate the report
S6F19 can tell you about reports, but you need to verify
event <<-->> RPTID so you get it all with S6F17
foreach event {
   do S6F17 get data of S6F13 
   verify RPTIDs and VIDs
   }
What most people do is reprogram the reports
 in fact this is standard VFEI
 S2F33 {L:2 {U4 0} L}  ;# erase all reports and links
 S2F33 {L:2 {U4 0} {L:n ...  define reports
 S2F35 define links
 S2F37 enable events
